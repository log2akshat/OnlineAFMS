app.welcome.note=<strong> IUCAA and NCRA-TIFR: </strong> \ <br> \
<img align="right" src="/INAT2015/images/iucaa_mod.png" width="350" height="215" />The Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune (an autonomous institution of the University Grants Commission), and the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (NCRA-TIFR), Pune, are two leading centres of research in a wide range of areas in Physics, and Astronomy and Astrophysics. IUCAA and NCRA-TIFR are located on neighbouring campuses in the Pune University Campus. <br> \ <br> \
IUCAA offers challenging opportunities to young researchers in theory, observation, and instrumentation in Astronomy and Astrophysics. Recently, IUCAA has acquired a share in the 10-m Southern African Large Telescope; it also operates the IUCAA Girawali Observatory with a 2-m optical telescope. Both these telescopes have imaging, spectroscopic and polarimetric capabilities. IUCAA also has a high-performance computational facility and a good library.<br> \ <br> \
<a href="/INAT2015/images/GMRT.jpg"><img align="left" src="/INAT2015/images/GMRT.png" width="280" height="220" /></a>NCRA-TIFR offers exciting opportunities for research in Astronomy and Astrophysics, and instrumentation, with an emphasis on Radio Astronomy. NCRA-TIFR has built and operates the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, which is located near Pune, and is the biggest and most powerful radio telescope in the world at low radio frequencies. NCRA-TIFR also operates the Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT), which is located near Udhagamandalam. Both GMRT and ORT have yielded several significant discoveries. NCRA-TIFR has modern computing facilities and an excellent library.\ <br> \ <br> \
<strong>IUCAA-NCRA Admission Test (INAT-2015):</strong> \ <br> \
The IUCAA-NCRA Admission Test (INAT-2015) is being conducted to select candidates for a research scholarship towards a Ph.D. at either IUCAA or NCRA-TIFR.

========================================================================================================================================================

title_guidelines=INSTRUCTIONS

app.guidelines=<strong> Eligibility </strong> \
<p align="justify"> \
\
Applications are invited from students who expect to complete their M.Sc., Integrated M.Sc. or B.E./B.Tech./M.E./M.Tech. degrees by August 2015 with 55% marks or more. Students in any branch of the B.E., B.Tech., M.E. or M.Tech. degrees, or in the Physics, Electronics, Astronomy or Applied Mathematics branches of the B.Sc. or M.Sc. degrees, are eligible to apply for INAT-2015. Students who have already completed any of the above degrees are also eligible. In addition, talented final-year B.Sc., 1st year M.Sc., 4th year Integrated M.Sc. and 2nd/3rd year B.E./B.Tech. students may also apply to be pre-selected for the Ph.D. programme at IUCAA.\
\
<br><br>\
Students who complete their M.Sc./Integrated M.Sc./M.E./M.Tech. degrees by August 2015 will be eligible for selection to the Ph.D. programme of both IUCAA and NCRA-TIFR. Students who complete their B.E./B.Tech. degrees by August 2015 are eligible for selection to the Ph.D. programme at IUCAA and to the Integrated Ph.D. programme at NCRA-TIFR (except for Engineering Physics students, who will be eligible for selection to the Ph.D. programme at NCRA-TIFR). Students who complete their B.Sc. degrees by August 2015 will be eligible for selection to the Integrated Ph.D. programme at NCRA-TIFR and for pre-selection to the Ph.D. programme at IUCAA. \
\
</p><br><p align="justify">\
		<strong>Selection Procedure:</strong> \
		<p align="justify"> \
We are looking for highly motivated students with a consistently good academic record. While we strongly encourage students from engineering backgrounds to apply for INAT-2015, we emphasize that we are looking for students who are interested in carrying out doctoral research in Physics, or Astronomy and Astrophysics. We hence expect prospective candidates to have a good understanding of basic Physics.  \
\
<br><br>\
Based on the applications and referee assessments, a subset of the candidates will be short-listed and invited to take the written test, to be held in Pune on Thursday, December 18, 2015. Candidates with 55% or more marks in the qualifying examination may <a href=ImpDates.ncra>walk-in</a> for the written test by producing a valid photo identification and a copy of their most recent marksheet. They should report at the Chandrasekhar Auditorium, IUCAA by 9:00 a.m. for verification of these documents, to ensure that there are no logistical problems. The final selection to the research scholarship will be based on the results of the written test (on Thursday, December 18, 2015) and two interviews (on Thursday, December 18, and/or Friday, December 19, 2015), both to be held in Pune. Note that, for both IUCAA and NCRA-TIFR, the selection through INAT is in addition to the selection through the Joint Entrance Screening Test (JEST).\
\ <br><br> \
<strong>Nature of the Written Test:</strong> \
<p align="justify">\
The test will be of TWO hours duration. The question paper will have two parts, A and B. Part A will contain twenty objective-type questions on basic Mathematics, Physics and Electronics. Part B will contain another twenty objective-type questions from advanced Physics, Mathematics and Electronics/Engineering. For each question, candidates will have to identify and mark the correct answer from the  given four answers. For a correct answer, there will be +3 (plus three) marks, and for a wrong answer, there will be -1 (minus one) mark. Based on their performance in the written test, a limited number of candidates will be invited for two interviews, which will be conducted on December 18 and/or 19, 2015. The final selection will be based on the scores in the written test and interviews. Candidates selected by either IUCAA or NCRA are expected to join in August 2015 (except for pre-selected candidates), after satisfactory completion of their qualifying examination.\
</p>\ <br> \
\
<strong>Travel and Stay:</strong> \
		<p align="justify">\
Outstation candidates will be paid one and one-third times the train/bus fare by second-class sleeper (NOT air-conditioned) from their place of residence (as given in the INAT-2015 Application Form) to Pune and back by the shortest route, as well as a  halting allowance (as per the prevailing rules) for each day of stay for the interviews. Outstation walk-in candidates who are shortlisted for the interviews will also be paid travel support as above. <br> \ <br> \
Limited accommodation, restricted to candidates who will appear for the written Admission Test, may be available on the IUCAA and NCRA-TIFR campuses at a nominal charge.  Those who wish to avail of this accommodation should send an e-mail request to the Co-ordinator, INAT-2015, at the e-mail address inat@ncra.tifr.res.in , before November 15, 2015. <br> \<br>\
\

						     			FAQs
========================================================================================================================================================
title_faqs	=	Frequently Asked Questions

faqs=<p align="justify">\
\<b>Question : </b>Am I eligible for the INAT ?\ <br> \
\<b>Answer : </b>The IUCAA-NCRA Admission Test (INAT-2015) is for students who will have completed their B.Tech., B.E., M.Sc., B.Sc. or Integrated M.Sc. (in Physics/Astronomy/Applied Mathematics/Electronics)  degrees by August 2015.  In addition, talented final year B.Sc., 1st year M.Sc., 4th year Integrated M.Sc. and 2nd/3rd year B.E./B.Tech. students may also apply to be PRE-SELECTED for a research scholarship towards a Ph.D. at IUCAA for Physics or Astronomy and Astrophysics; such students would join IUCAA after completing their degree. Note that students who have completed their B.Tech., B.E., M.Sc. or Integrated M.Sc. degrees by August 2015 would be eligible for IUCAA and NCRA's Ph.D. programmes, while students who have completed their B.Sc. degree by August 2015 would be eligible for NCRA's Integrated Ph.D. programme. \ <br> \<br> \
\
\<b>Question : </b>Will postal applications and referee reports be accepted ?\ <br> \
\<b>Answer : </b>Only online applications and referee reports will be accepted; we will not accept postal or e-mail applications.\ <br> \<br> \
\
\<b>Question : </b>Whom should I choose as a referee ?\ <br> \
\<b>Answer : </b>A referee is a member of the academic community who can provide a fair assessment  of  your academic career. The best referees are typically supervisors on previous research projects, teachers at your academic institution, and faculty members with whom you have discussed science issues. Family members or other relatives, friends and fellow students will NOT be accepted as referees.\ <br> \<br> \
\
\<b>Question : </b>Will my application be considered for screening without referee reports ?\ <br> \
\<b>Answer : </b>It will not be possible to screen your application without at least one and preferably two referee reports.\ <br> \<br> \
\
\<b>Question : </b>Can I update/modify my application details once they have been submitted ?\ <br> \
\<b>Answer : </b> Yes. You can update  your application  until the application deadline (September 22, 2015), using your Online ID and Password.\ <br> \<br> \
\
\<b>Question : </b>My examination dates clash with the INAT-2015 dates; can the INAT dates be shifted ?\ <br> \
\<b>Answer : </b>We appreciate that the INAT-2015 dates may clash with examinations at some institutions. Unfortunately, we cannot alter the dates for individual students. We recommend that students whose examination dates clash with INAT-2015 should apply to IUCAA and NCRA via the JEST.\ <br> \<br> \
\
\<b>Question : </b>Will I be provided with accommodation during the days of the INAT written test and the interviews ?\ <br> \
\<b>Answer : </b>Limited accomodation will be available on the IUCAA and NCRA campuses for INAT-2015 candidates. If you would like to avail of this accomodation, please send an e-mail to the Co-ordinator, INAT-2015, at the e-mail address inat@ncra.tifr.res.in by November 15, 2015.\ <br> \<br> \
\
\<b>Question : </b>My referees have not gotten the e-mail asking them for the confidential assessment.\ <br> \
< \<b>Answer : </b>There are two likely reasons for your referees not receiving our e-mail: (1) you have entered an incorrect e-mail address in your online application, and (2) our mail has, for some reason, been placed in the SPAM folder of your referee''s mailbox. If your referees have not received our e-mail within a day of your submitting the application form, check that their e-mail addresses in the online application form are correct. If there is an error here, correct the addresses and re-submit the application form. If the addresses are correct, ask your referees to check their SPAM folders. If neither of these solves the problem, click the button to re-send the e-mails to the referees. Note that our e-mails to the referee are sent by an automatic procedure and we have tested the system extensively to make sure that it works. Individual failures are certainly possible, but these should be solved by simply clicking the button to re-send the referee e-mails.\ <br> \<br> \
\
\<b>Question : </b>My referee has received his/her ID and password, but is unable to log in.\ <br> \
\<b>Answer : </b>The most likely cause is that the candidate has updated his/her application form with changed referee details (e.g. different name or e-mail address), but has not send the password to the updated e-mail ID of the referee. This registered e-mail ID is used for logging in to the confidential assessment form. In this situation, the referee will be unable to log in to the referee page. If you change any of referee details, please be sure to re-send the password to the referee using the ''Send Password'' utility, which you can access after logging in to your profile with your OnlineID and Password.\ <br> \<br> \
\
\<b>Question : </b>I am a foreign student (studying either in India or outside India). Am I eligible for the INAT-2015 ?\ <br> \
\<b>Answer : </b>Yes, you are eligible for the INAT, with the same eligibility criteria as for Indian students. However, all foreigners require clearance from the Indian government before joining IUCAA or NCRA. Selection to IUCAA or NCRA via the INAT will be subject to this clearance.\ <br> \<br> \
\
\<b>Question : </b>The INAT application form asks for the percentage in the under-graduate degree, but some colleges don''t follow the percentage system. What sould I enter here ?\ <br> \
\<b>Answer : </b>If your College/University follows a grading system but without a standard formula to convert the grade into a percentage, please enter your grade in the "Grade" column and enter 100 x (your_grade/maximum_grade) in the percentage column. We will then only use the grade during the evaluation.\ <br> <br> \
\
\<b>Question : </b>I was not invited to take INAT-2015; can I still appear for INAT-2015 ? Will the fact that I was not short-listed affect my selection ? \ <br> \
\<b>Answer : </b> Even if you have not been invited, you can definitely appear for the INAT-2015 written test as a walk-in candidate, provided your percentage in the qualifying examination is at least 55%. The initial short-listing is merely for guaranteed TA/DA coverage. The final selection to IUCAA and NCRA-TIFR will not in any way be affected by whether or not you have been short-listed initially. Further, if you clear the INAT written test, you too would be paid TA/DA exactly on par with the initially shortlisted candidates. Walk-in candidates should arrive at the Chandrasekhar Auditorium at 9:00 AM on Thursday, December 18, 2015, with a copy of the marksheet of the qualifying examination.\ <br> \<br> \
\
\<b>FAQs regarding what to expect in the interviews: </b>\ <br> <br> \
\
\<b>Questions : </b>Do I need to know astronomy?\ <br> \
\<b>Answer : </b>No prior knowledge of Astronomy is needed to get selected to IUCAA and NCRA.\ <br> <br> \
\
\<b>Questions : </b>I am from an Engineering background; do I need to know advanced topics like quantum mechanics, field theory or special relativity?\ <br> \
\<b>Answer : </b> We expect prospective candidates to have a good understanding of basic physics, but not of advanced topics. All students who are selected to join IUCAA or NCRA will be exposed to advanced Physics and Astrophysics via courses in the first year of graduate school.\ <br> <br> \
\
\<b>Questions : </b>I am finishing my M.Sc. in Physics. Do I need to be to have a good understanding of all subjects covered in the M.Sc., or can I simply focus on a few topics of my interest?\ <br> \
\<b>Answer : </b> We do not expect you to know every subject covered in the M.Sc. equally well. However, we do expect you to have a good understanding of basic Physics.\ <br> <br> \
\
\<b>Questions : </b>How long does an interview last generally and will there be more then one interview?\ <br> \
\<b>Answer : </b> Typically, a single interview will last for about 30-45 minutes. Each student selected for the interviews will go through two such interviews, with independent interview committees.\ <br> <br> \
\
\<b>Questions : </b>Are the interviews aimed at testing the student's memory or assessing problem-solving abilities ?\ <br> \
\<b>Answer : </b>The interviews aim to check the students' understanding of Physics, and their ability to solve Physics problems posed to them. They are also aimed at testing the understanding of basic concepts, and not the ability to memorize formulae or laws. </p>

RejectionMailSubject	=	Regret: Not shortlisted for INAT-2015
RejectionMessage	= We have now completed the selection procedure for candidates for the IUCAA-NCRA Admission Test (INAT-2015), to be held at the Chandrasekhar Auditorium, IUCAA, Pune, on Thursday, December 18, 2015. We had a large number of excellent applications this year, 1121 in total, and were only able to invite around 371 candidates for the test. Unfortunately, your application did not make it to our short list. We will hence be unable to invite you to take the INAT-2015 written test. \n \
\n \
Please note, however, that candidates with more than 55% in the qualifying examination may walk-in for the INAT-2015 written test by producing a valid photo identification at the Chandrasekhar Auditorium, IUCAA, at 9:00 AM on Thursday, December 18, 2015. All such walk-in candidates who clear the written test will be eligible for the selection interviews, and will also be paid a travel and halting allowance. We emphasize that walk-in candidates will be treated in exactly the same manner as invited candidates in terms of the written test and the interviews; the only difference is that walk-in candidates will only be paid the travel and halting allowance if they clear the written test. The final selection to a Ph.D. research scholarship at IUCAA and NCRA-TIFR will be made on the basis of the scores in the written INAT-2015 test and the two interviews; see the INAT-2015 webpage http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in:8080/INAT2015 for further information. \n \
\n \
The walk-in candidates may download the Application form and the Admit Form from http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/for-students/research/inat_forms and bring it along with you at the time of the written test. \n \
\n \
We are sorry that we are unable to invite you for the INAT-2015 written test. However, we encourage you to continue in your research efforts and hope that you will consider IUCAA and NCRA-TIFR as possible institutions for your future studies. \n \
\n \
