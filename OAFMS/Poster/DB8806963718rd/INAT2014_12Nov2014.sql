However, due to his interest in astrophysics, I interacted with Himadri more and discovered about his interest and motivation for research.  Himadri visited IUCAA and NCRA as a part of the academic trip from the Presidency Physics department. After coming back from that trip Himadri was zealous about astrophysics and started working on a project with Prof. Saumyadip Samui on an astrophysics related topic. Himadri also volunteered to give a presentation on \"Spectroscopic Measurements in Astronomy\", where he did a commendable job.  During the tutorial sessions of my quantum mechanics class, I made my students come to the board and lead discussions. Himadri participated in such discussions and lead problem solving sessions.  His major strength is indeed his willingness to learn. ','His  major weakness is his handicap with the English language. Himadri grew up in a remote area in the district of Maldah (W.B) and has poor knowledge of English. Sometimes his ability to express a scientific concept gets shrouded by his inability to communicate in English. \r\n\r\nHimadri does not have strong leadership qualities. He often looks up to the mentorship of his teachers. However with well motivation he can perform well. This happened in my quantum mechanics class too. Himadri secured an A+ grade (80%-90%) in the class and performed very well during the exam.  However, it did require lot of motivation from my part. He never secured an A+ grade in any other theory class and this shows his longing for support and mentorship.

In the tutorial sessions, Rudrani was one of the few students in the class, who enthusiastically participated in the tutorial sessions and lead discussions. However, some of her strong talents became evident to me when she started working with me for her thesis work. \r\n\r\n           I was highly impressed with her initiative in getting in touch with me about the project even before I joined the department (before November 2013). The title of her thesis is X-ray Surface Brightness Profile in Simulated Clusters. In her thesis, Rudrani computed the X-ray surface brightness profiles of galaxy clusters using data from one of the first cosmological hydrodynamic simulation that includes feedback from active galactic nuclei (DiMatteo et al. 2008). She qualitatively compared her theoretical results with data. \r\n\r\nRudrani has shown high motivation in research. She read lengthy and technically challenging research papers and summarized the main results in a coherent manner. She was capable of doing that with minimal help from me and without ever taking any astrophysics course before. In her thesis, she worked with a complicated numerical code to calculate the X-ray surface brightness profiles. The numerical code involved programming in MATLAB, which she learned reasonably quickly (she had absolutely no experience with MATLAB). As a requirement for her mid semester evaluation she gave one of the best talks in the department on her thesis topic. She also answered several intricate and technically challenging questions from other faculty members. She presented the result of her thesis in the topical conference on gravity and cosmology (TCGC) eastern region in front of a serious audience and did a commendable job on that.  \r\n\r\nHer major strength is her ambition to perform well. Rudrani regularly attended our departmental astrophysics journal club. She volunteered to give a talk on cosmological simulations in the journal club session. Her dedication to perform well in the journal club presentation (which is completely voluntary and has no connection with her grades) is a manifestation of her will to give the effort for acquiring perfection.\r\n\r\n','One area where Rudrani needs to improve is her speaking style. She has decent communication skills but her submissive speaking style sometimes fail to convey her leadership and mastery in the subject area, which eventually hurts her performance.

Each year, close to 3000 students take the admission test for the BSc physics course at Presidency and forty of them get admitted. It is quite competitive and the quality of students in each class is one of the best in the region. There were more than fifteen students, including Namrata, who are recipients of the prestigious DST INSPIRE fellowship in her BSc class. In my experience, Namrata was one of the top three sharpest students in that class. When I introduced a new topic in class or taught a relatively intricate topic she was often the first student to grasp the idea and respond accordingly. I used to give homework problem-sets regularly and asked the students to do those problems in the biweekly tutorial class. She did most of the problems easily. In more than one case, she did a problem from the first principle requiring significant amount of original thinking instead of an easier plug and chug method.  I am convinced that she has the academic potential to carry out excellent research in theoretical physics.\r\n\r\nI have not taught her current class (MSc 1st yr) yet but I am sure she is again one of the top students in her current class as well. ','There is still some room for improvement for Namrata. She can be a little impatient sometimes which results in her making silly mistakes in tests. That has often been the difference between her getting the full marks in a question and getting only partial credit. She needs to be guided and motivated by one or more suitable mentor(s). Her performance often radically improves when she is really motivated to do well. I do believe that given the opportunity and proper motivation she can be a formidable force in successfully addressing complex theoretical problems in physics. ','Top 5%','1. Namrata Roy.\r\n2.

She will also do a semester-long research project in Spring 2016 which is part of the curriculum at Presidency. \r\n\r\nShe took a BSc computational physics course where she started slowly but learned quite a lot and did well in the exam at the end. She will take an advanced computational course as an elective next year. I expect her to strengthen her computational skill in that course.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is expected that when she gets her MSc degree her knowledge of astrophysics and preparation for a research career will be well-beyond the average students in many institutions in India who are finishing their Masters courses. ','Namrata has started working on a research project with me from June of this year. I asked her to read about synchrotron radiation from the books by Rybicki and Lightman, and Longair and told her to work out the steps in between the lines as much as possible. She was successful in doing so within a reasonable amount of time. Then I instructed her to find out how a certain high-energy electron distribution will evolve with time if it is emitting synchrotron radiation. She read about Fokker-Planck (diffusion) equation by herself and solved the problem. Now she is continuing to read more advanced topics related to this and I have given her another problem that is one step harder than the previous one. I expect that she will soon acquire a sound understanding of high energy radiation processes. Finally, I plan to give her a problem related to time variability of emission from the jets of blazars. I expect her to make significant progress in that project by the end of summer 2015 (she is taking MSc courses now and is pretty busy).  \r\n\r\nI knew about her mathematical ability from the classes. During this project I have been happily noticing that she is making quick progress by applying her aptitude in good effect to seek out right resources, make logical assumptions, and finally solving problems in completely unknown topics.

In the zeroth order assumption, an astrophysical accretion disk is supposed to be an optically thick disk that emits as a blackbody. The only catch is the temperature of the disk is a function of its radius. As a result, the disk emits as a so-called multi-color blackbody. As an initiation to the research project, I asked her to carry out an analytical calculation to derive the emission spectrum of an accretion disk. She came up with the correct multi-color blackbody solution without any intervention from me. Then I told her to write a computer program to model such a disk and see if she gets the same solution numerically. To my amazement, she again succeeded within a reasonable time without much help from me. She then went on to using her program (written in C, which she already knew) to get a few more expected results. After that I asked her to add time variability in the temperature of the disk and explore its effects on the emission and she worked on that problem for some time.

I have seen his keen interest in following classical mechanics using standard books like Goldstein. He reads beyond the syllabus and has critical questions on everything he study.

For example he suggested one student to determine the velocity of the wind based on the doppler shift in sound. To do this, he used the Raspberry Pi  and the beats produced by the buzzer and its shifted frequency to find the change in frequency!  He actually verified it and demonstrated to me. Then assuming velocity of sound in medium (which also he could determine using raspberry pi), he suggested to estimate the speed of wind. ','He is very good.

He has exceptional mathematical capabilities and is by far the most advanced student in his class. He definitely asks some of the smartest questions in class.  He has already studied advanced topics in quantum mechanics all by himself and has discussed with me about many fundamental concepts in the subject. \r\n\r\nWith little help from Prof. Saumyadip Samui he has taught himself general relativity and on his own, once engaged himself in writing down a covariant formalism of Schrodinger equation along with one of his bright classmates. \r\n\r\nSuman has discussed with me about different topics in cosmology. Being a second year undergraduate student he was already aware of the CMB power spectrum and the phys ics behind it.  After a seminar on cosmological structure formulation, he quite independently asked me the possibility of calculating the average distance between dark matter halos as a function of halo mass. This forms the basis of understanding dark matter clustering. While discussing the concepts he made some comments which were at the level of an advanced graduate student. \r\n\r\nFrom my discussion with my colleague, Prof. Ritaban Chatterjee, I have learned that Suman , quite easily was capable of visualizing the celestial sphere and drawing conclusions from it. He has tremendous interest in astrophysics. He worked on transit methods for detecting extra-solar planets for a summer project. He also had studied different topics in astrophysics. To feed his scientific curiosity, recently, I have asked him to read a paper (Hu and Sugiyama 1995) on analytically calculating the Boltzmann code using the \r\ntight coupling approximation.  \r\n\r\nSuman is also the class topper (in a class with about 80% students being INSPIRE fellows) and is extremely meticulous with coursework and lab. Suman is both brilliant and hardworking which should make him very successful as a graduate student.  He rarely misses class, and does all his homeworks perfectly. He is very unassuming and is not conscious about his brilliance.  That makes his case a more promising one.  ','Spoken English is a huge handicap for Suman.  To overcome this problem I have forced Suman to communicate with me in English. However Suman sometimes fails to convey his command on a subject area due to his inability to speak the English language. \r\n\r\nApparently due to his youth he could be a bit opinionated about a particular subject field.

Besides, he is ready to doggedly pour through large amounts of data, looking for any slightest anomalies. He would back his findings up with his interpretation, and bring them for discussions.

I strongly feel that he has the right mix of skills required for becoming a good experimentalist.\r\n    Further, Avinash showed great energy, enthusiasm and perseverance in laboratory work. He was meticulous in all details of the experiments that needed his attention. He was always willing to put in extra efforts, take up night shifts, etc, whether at TIFR or at VSSC Trivandrum. Whenever a task was assigned to Avinash, I could rest assured that he will go and procure whatever support he needs from colleagues or senior lab staff to get things done, get them done well, and get them done on time. In doing so, he has also demonstrated his abilities to work with groups, and to lead them to goals.','Avinash has a rather quiet temperament, and is a bit under-confident.

Physics in 2014. I am vary dedicated and passionate about physics. Because of my interest in Astrophysics i chose astrophysics and cosmology in my course work. Along with them i have studied Quantum field theory and particle physics. I did a summer project with Prof. Patrick Das Gupta on \"white dwarf and neutron star\" . In final year, I did a project with Prof. Seshadri on \" Modelling of eclipsing binary stars using photometric data\". At present , i am a JRF at Physical research laboratory at Ahemdabad. ','Yes',NULL,'Theory','Astronomy and Astrophysics is a very fascinating subject in itself primarily because the sky looks beautiful with stars shinning and other astrophysical objects. Secondly, there is so less knowledge available to human about universe. The thing i like most about the subject is, take any astrophysical object or any astrophysical phenomenon , it can be explained by simple laws of mechanics, gravity, thermodynamics, statistical physics etc. Though i like the subject as a whole, my research interest lies in \"Solar Physics\". And the thing which startles me is the sudden variation in magnetic field of Sun. As we know that the magnetic strength is decreasing and the period of cycle is also increasing, I want to work on it since it will help in understanding the origin of magnetic field in Sun and hence other Stars. I was interested in Astrophysics since my school time but I got this particular interest during my project with Prof. Patrick Das Gupta, while studying neutron stars and their magnetic field. Since then , I am so much keen to study more and more about the magnetic field of stars. Since Sun is the star which is easiest to study and its showing an abnormal behaviour presently, it will be helpful in studying stellar evolution at later stage.  But i am not confined to it . As i mentioned , I am interested in Astrophysics as a whole and i believe studying one thing leads to some understanding of other things. \r\n','I did a project in my M.sc. final with Prof. T R Seshadri on \" Modelling of Eclipsing Binary stars using photometric data using PHOEBE software\" . In the project,  Light curves analysis of stars OGLE-03160 and OGLE-00004 were presented using photometric data from OGLE (Optical gravitational lensing Experiment) .In the last 40-50 \r\nyears, Eclipsing Binaries have been an efficient area of research due to its geometry which permits the observer to get various physical parameters and shape of an individual star.Different morphological structure of Eclipsing Binaries using Roche model and corresponding light curves were also presented. Using various statistical techniques such as Wilson Devinney (WD code), Differential correction etc., it was shown how Phoebe encounter the inverse problem and degenerate solution problem. From the synthetic and \r\nobserved curve matching, the physical parameters describing a star which match perfectly \r\nwith the theory of eclipsing binary stars ware evaluated.','&amp;#61623; Stood First at state Level in Mathematics Olympiad during school time.\r\n&amp;#61623; Got excellence award from Ratna Sagar for my performance in Mathematics. \r\n','Gate 2014 : 409 AIR\r\nCSIR-NET : 35 AIR','No','Rejected','No','No','2014-08-22 02:13:32'),(145,'ASHISH KUNGHATKAR','1989-12-11','Male','INDIAN','ashkunghatkar@gmail.com','G-4, SAPTAGIRI MAHARSHI VILLA, 5TH CROSS, HAL 3RD STAGE, 13TH MAIN KODIHALLI, BANGALORE','560008','BANGALORE','Karnataka','08867658989','MANIPAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,\r\nNEAR TIGER CIRCLE, MANIPAL\r\nDIST:- UDUPI\r\n','576104','MANIPAL','Karnataka','OBC','Xth Std','N.

These stars- the high mass ones among them- went unstable in their later years- they collapsed and then exploded- scattering their enriched guts across the galaxy- guts made of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and all the fundamental ingredients of life itself. These ingredients become part of gas clouds that condense, collapse, form the next generation of solar systems- stars with orbiting planets. And those planets now have the ingredients for life itself. So that when I look up at the night sky, and I know that yes we are part of this universe, we are in this universe, but perhaps more important than both of those facts is that the universe is in us. When I reflect on that fact, I look up- many people feel small, cause their small and the universe is big.

Transitional disks, a class of protoplanetary disk around young stars, show evidence for the presence of large radial gaps within them which is expected to have occurred due to grain processing and massive planet formation. We found a surprising result, by analyzing the 10 micron silicate emission feature obtained from Spitzers IRS spectra of 160 young stars in the Taurus star forming region with the help of Python programming, that transitional disks appear to have relatively unprocessed grains in the. Also, I tried to account for this anomaly.','Theory, Observations, Computation','From a very young age I idolized Kalpana Chawla. I started dreaming of being an astronaut like her. Over time, my passion towards astronomy and astrophysics lead me to choose an Integrated Physics program in order to have a Doctoral Degree in Astronomy and Astrophysics. \r\n\r\nModern science has developed tremendously but there are still many fields which has unsolved puzzles. One such field is Astronomy and Astrophysics. We still havent unraveled the mysteries of our dynamic nature of the sun also we dont know much about exoplanetary systems, dark matter, black holes etc. Astronomy as a whole is a subject of wonders to me. According to me the aim of every astrophysicist is to answer the questions about objects they see in the night sky. The night skys appealing view had always intrigued me in understanding the physical mechanism which governs the existence of several planets, stars, galaxies etc in our universe\r\n\r\nDuring my summer internship in Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC-ISRO) on the topic of Solar Wind and Its Interaction with Earth I learnt about dynamical behavior of Sun and studied about its different chemical and physical processes, also, I studied about the solar wind and Coronal Mass Ejections in detail. During the course of this project I received a firsthand knowledge on data handling and modeling. After the project I got an incentive to study about other stars beyond our solar system and I gained a keen interest on learning about Stellar Astrophysics. To achieve my interest I did another summer project in Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) on the topic of The Anomalous Dust Composition in Transitional Disks. Through this project I learnt about the evolution of young stars and the laws physics governing the existence of different types of protoplanetary disks around young stars (Class II stars). Due to my interest in astronomy I have also become an active member of Astronomy Club of Pondicherry University. In this club I learnt about observational and instrumental astronomy. We assembled telescopes and learnt about different types of telescopes, optics used in telescopes, different mounting techniques and different coordinate systems used in terms of astronomers. We saw different stellar objects along with the visible arm of the Milky Way galaxy.\r\n\r\nThe projects and Astronomy Club have helped me in preserving my interest in this filed along with providing me with an inspiration on most different sub-fields in Astronomy. I have been immensely curious to learn more about solar astrophysics, stellar evolution and star birth and death and use my knowledge of computation in these fields. I will be extremely grateful to be selected in the INAT Phd program because I believe Astronomy and Astrophysics is a field which is in the process of its growth and research prospect in this field is tremendous.

Ever since then, the seminars, lectures, workshops, conferences that i had an opportunity to attend, amused and attracted to the subject more and more. This also helped me get involved in the local Amateur Astronomy club, through which i could get better glimpses of the subject and also mingle with better people to gain knowledge. Apart from great visual treats i obtained through the night sky observations through the club, i also got introduced to the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and got to meet people working on various aspects of Astronomy and Astrophysics.\r\nThe subject is a vast ocean with many things yet to be discovered, understood and communicated. In connection with IIA helped me focus my interest on specific areas in the astronomy like AGNs and Blackholes. These areas have gained a lot of importance as it might help us in understanding the structure, nature of neutrino stars, Black holes and Super Massive Black holes which is very much important to understand our Galaxy and its behavior.And the same intention has driven me to develop an interest in AGNs and study the physics behind various phenomena related to AGNs. \r\nAstronomy is not just about one area, its a through combination of various other fields and its more of an inter-Disciplinary science. In this regard, I have been constantly trying to update myself with the current happenings in the field, by trying to understand the theoretical aspects, observational aspects along with learning the necessary technical skills pertaining to usage of packages like IRAF and programming languages like R, IDL/GDL. The fascination has not just stopped at astronomy/astrophysics but also in trying to understand how other sub-disciplines like particle physics co-relate to astronomy. With this motivation a small project at postgraduation level, on study of muons is also being carried out  just to realise the merging point of these two fields. ','1. Worked on modelling the nature of spin and characterizing muon radius invoking alpha-quantized mass relation.\r\n2. Worked on modelling the solar prominence oscillations and hence study the dynamics of solar prominence.\r\n3.

Hence my purpose for applying for PhD is to both expand on my existing knowledge and to create additional opportunities for myself in the future. \r\nI always have been interested in Astronomy. The study of outer space always fascinated me and Black Holes caught my curiosity the most. Right from the onset of my academic studies, fascination for the sciences drove me to take up Physics at the undergraduate level. I got my Bachelors Degree from Govt. College for Women, Rohtak, Haryana. While in my graduation, I was introduced to a new field in physics, Nanotechnology. The ability to manipulate materials at the nano-scale drove me towards this field of Physics.\r\nWith the aim of deepening my knowledge in these two fields, I enrolled for Masters of Science program at the University of Delhi. My selection was based on a nationwide entrance examination conducted by the university. In the 3 semester of M.Sc. I got the opportunity of getting adequate exposure in most of the subjects that interested me previously. During my final year, I chose Astrophysics, General Theory of Relativity and Nanotechnology as the subjects. While studying General Theory of Relativity, I got to experience the beauty of outer space. The curvature of spacetime is a great concept which defines the unknown facts about space in which Black Hole is the most amazing one and also my ultimate interest.\r\nI think Nanotechnology can be a very good tool in unraveling the mysteries of outer space. But before one can proceed towards the application of nanoscience in space technology one needs to have a sound theoretical background about the Subject of interest. Thus I first want to quantify my knowledge about space more specifically about the Black holes.\r\nI feel doing my PhD at your institute would be the most logical extension of my objective. I am confident that the wholesome education that I receive at your institute will stand me in good stead throughout my career. I would be grateful to you if I am accorded the opportunity to pursue my higher studies here. I am sure that I will be able to achieve my goals while keeping up with the institutes expectations. \r\n','','','','No','Selected','No','No','2014-08-26 21:30:59'),(58,'SHIJIN CHERIAN THOMAS','1989-07-22','Male','INDIAN','shijinedathinethu08@gmail.com','Edathinethu House\r\nPulloopuram P.O\r\nRanny','689674','Pathanamthitta','Kerala','04735228920','Edathinethu House\r\nPulloopuram P.O\r\nRanny','689674','Pathanamthitta','Kerala','General','Xth Std','ST MARYS SENIOR SECONDARY SCHOOL','CBSE',2005,'',75,'XIIth Std','ST MARYS SENIOR SECONDARY SCHOOL','CBSE',2007,'',71,'B.Tech.','MUSALIAR COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY','MAHATMA GANDHI UNIVERS',2011,'',75,'M.Tech.','HINDUSTAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE','HINDUSTAN UNIVERSITY',2014,'',88,'M Tech Process Control and Instrumentation','2014','Dr U RAMACHANDRAIAH\r\nPROFESSOR &amp; HEAD\r\nELECTRONICS AND INSTRUMENTATION Dept\r\nHINDUSTAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE\r\nHINDUSTAN UNIVERSITY\r\nCHENNAI','Mr G MUTHUKUMARAN\r\nASSOCIATE PROFESSOR \r\nELECTRONICS AND INSTRUMENTATION Dept\r\nHINDUSTAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE\r\nHINDUSTAN UNIVERSITY\r\nCHENNAI','Just Completed M Tech in 2014','No',NULL,'Theory, Observations, Computation','The technology applied in exploring the secrets of the universe makes me moved towards the Astrophysics and I would like to work with the radars and high power telescopes.

To observe and perceive is our nature, gazing in the night at the stars, and other heavenly bodies, inspired me, how it would be to imagine ourselves witnessing every cosmological or astronomical event closely.  Extrapolating the models of structure of an atom gives us the vague picture of the Structure of Universe. I am mesmerized with this Duality in Creation, which actually overwhelmed me after reading Angels and Demons by Dan Brown, where he emphasised on our Father of Modern Science Galilee Galileo.\r\nAstronomy and Astrophysics almost involves all branches of physics and a bit of Chemistry and Biology. Basically, studying this subject will makes us learn in an interdisciplinary approach.\r\n Reading about phenomenal Physicists and Mathematicians like Aryabhata, Bhaskara I, Varahmira, Brahmagupta, Newton, Leibnitz, Gauss, Euler, Hamilton, Einstein, Oppenheimer, Feynman , Hawking etc,  its very overwhelming and breathtaking, how they dedicated their entire lives to the field of Physics and Mathematics . Its very inspirational, and of course most us have been keeping them as our role models.\r\nMany powerful simulation softwares like HEALpix , CAMB , CosmoPC, CLASS has helped astronomers and astrophysicists for analyzing the data obtained from different kinds of Telescopes. Many Giant Telescope Projects for the future like GMT, TMT, EELT will leap into farther regions of space and gives us better understanding of our universe.\r\nWatching documentaries by Carl Sagan has had a great influence. I have attended many seminars at IIA and Christ University by various distinguished Professors from India and abroad on topics of Astronomy and Astrophysics like UVIT, Dark Matter and Dark Energy, Solar flares, Epoch of recombination, Cosmology, TMT etc , which has been very informative and inspirational to pursue a career in the field. \r\n','1) Autonomous Emergency Braking system demonstrated (AEBS) on a Go-kart (JUNE 2013)  \r\nThis incorporates an Ultrasonic sensor detection system for detecting the potential obstacles within the range of 3m to 5m radius, and autonomously applies brakes when it is needed.\r\n2) Working as an intern (January 2014 to present), in IIA (Indian Institute of Astrophysics) under Professor Dr.Padmakar Singh Parihar on TMT project (Thirty meter Telescope).

Long before I was aware that I can make a career out of it, I became absolutely obsessed with the night sky. A number of events lead to this obsession at a very young age. The TV show called \"Into the Universe with Stephen Hawking\", the book named \"Physics of the impossible\" by Michio Kaku, the first visit to the planetarium, the first close look at the Moon through a telescope, the book named \"Into the night sky\", the list goes on and on. All these things elevated the interest gradually. The soul dream became to reach the stars and study of astronomy and astrophysics provides that perfect stepping stone and opportunity to realize the dream. Study of astronomy and astrophysics at the moment seems to be the perfect path, the best one that I can follow to get even close to my dreams. Stephen Hawking once said and I quote, \"No one undertakes research in physics with the intention of winning a prize. It is the joy of discovering something no one knew before.\" When I look towards the heavens at night, every time I see a new dot appearing in the vast oblivion and it is amazing just above our head resides the unknown, uncharted cosmic ocean. Each look at it through the telescope reveals something completely new and different. A new extra-solar planet, a new nebula, a new comet, a new star, a new black hole, a new cosmic phenomenon and the search for the beginning of time. There is much to learn, much to explore, but what supersedes all is the joy and wonder each look, each step provides. It is an extraordinary time to be around because we just realized the vastness of the universe and how little we know about it. As a human being I get the interest from the most basic instinct that has been pushing the frontiers of civilization forward from the very beginning of human existence, curiosity.','','','',NULL,'Rejected','No','No','2014-08-27 09:53:31'),(64,'Kingsuk Kashyap Kalita','1989-07-29','Male','Indian','quantamgravity@gmail.com','C/O, Minakshi Bora,\r\nDawson H.

When I look up at the night sky, a wave of queries passes through my mind. What the stars are? How they shine and where from they come? \r\n              From ancient time, human minds have been searching for the ultimate answer of the mysterious question mark regarding the stars. As Astrophysics is the tool for study of the structural and evolutionary behaviour of the stars, it is interesting and exciting for me to understand what the constituents of a star are and how one can reveal the secrets of various stellar properties. \r\n          Being a student of astrophysics, when I look up at the night sky through a telescope, I amaze observing the Moon, Saturn, Venus, Vega, Arcturus etc. planets and stars. I am motivated to see how we can extract the different properties of stars, life time and their evolutionary track from the H-R diagram. Involved in some exercise in SDSS Sky Server, given as assignment by one of my Astrophysics teacher, I have become ambitious to use a rich material of astrophysical data to uncover the Universe.\r\n            The most important part of Astrophysics is to reveal the mystery of evolution of the Universe and to know the fate of the Universe. Big Bang, Black Hole, Supernova, Galaxies, Neutron stars, Clusters of stars, Dark energy , Dark Matter, Gravitational Wave etc. all are conquered by Astrophysics.\r\n\r\n      Four hundreds of years ago Galileo stepped forward through observation. Kepler came with three beautiful laws. From Newtons gravity to Einsteins space-time, almost all the mysteries of the Universe have been uncovered. But I am eager to know what the mysteries are left in the Universe to be revealed and to find some relation between the Universe and life itself.\r\n','','','','No','Rejected','No','No','2014-08-27 11:08:37'),(65,'richa shrimali','1991-01-09','Female','indian','richa.shrimali9@gmail.com','8 b bari brahmpuri \r\npali marwar\r\nrajasthan','306401','Pali','Rajasthan','8386896170','8 b bari brahmpuri \r\npali marwar\r\nrajasthan','306401','Pali','Rajasthan','General','Xth Std','shree mahaveer girls sr sec school,ranawas','rbsc',2006,'1',77,'XIIth Std','bangur govt. sr sec school,pali ','rbsc',2008,'1',66,'B.Sc.','bangur govt. college,pali','mds university ajmer',2011,'1',66,'M.Sc.','mlv govt. college,bhilwara','mds university ajmer',2014,'1',68,'msc in physics','2014','gajendra dave \r\nLecturer of physics in Govt.

It was not just academics, I learnt way more than that, I leaned how the way things work around and how most things have to be experienced to be known about them.\r\n','No',NULL,'Theory, Observations, Computation','     There is a very vivid memory of my childhood which, I believe,  describes my budding interest in Astrophysics. It was one evening that I asked my Father while studying an Astronomy chapter from my Geography textbook. I asked him how do days and nights take place exactly, and he smiled said its amazing how it works and told me about the the Earth and how it revolutes around itself while rotating around the Giant sun using a plastic ball as Earth and our light bulb as sun, he showed how the Earth revolves around itself spinning the ball with his fingers and thus describes me how it caused days and nights to take place. I was absolutely amused with the way it worked. That amusing feeling still is in me and comes out whenever I learn something about Astrophysics.\r\n   Since I was a child I have been amazed by how the Universe works, with all the Planets, Satellites, Stars and the Galaxies. I have always had a thoughtful approach towards life, and how things work. As a student, I used to attend IUCAA lectures every Saturday with my School friends, I was very much amazed by the things that were said and discussed in that hall. Even the Sundial and the statue of Newton were a treat to watch. That IUCAA garden still remains in my memory and has been an integral part of my life. I wanted to be like those people who used to give lectures on Astronomy and Astrophysics. I want to change lives of the young minds the way they did mine.\r\n     As Newton puts it, \"I was like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.\" and true so, that ocean is still undiscovered and I want to give my contribution to discover it. I believe what the people at IUCAA are doing one of the best jobs ever. Finding answers. Everything I ever read about Astrophysics and I mean everything has been absolutely mind blowing, that too putting it in a subtle way. Be it Einsteins Theory of Relativity or The approach for Unified Theory, it has been an absolute pleasure knowing and discovering things. I want to use this interest of mine into something greater and I believe this PhD programme gives me a proper opportunity to do so. It is not only my interest in Theoretical Astrophysics but Mathematics too which will help me at observation and computation  in research work in Observational Astrophysics. The Cosmos has great things to offer, life is one of them, and the most beautiful so. And we should use this gift of life given to us by the Cosmos to know how it all started and how we came so far.','I have completed my project work in the field of Thermal Engineering on the Title Design and Fabrication of Thermoacoustic Cooler as a partial fulfilment in my Degree of Mechanical Engineering. Thermoacoustic Refrigerator is a device that operates efficiently by using sound waves and non flammable environmentally friendly gases. Refrigeration in thermodynamics refers to a cycle in which heat is pumped out of a system by doing work on it. Thermoacoustic Refrigerator uses sound waves to transfer heat from one area to another. Thereby carrying heat away from a system to an exhaust. Acoustic or sound waves can be utilized to produce cooling. The pressure variations in the acoustic wave are accompanied by temperature variations due to compressions and expansions of the gas.','','','No','Rejected','No','No','2014-08-27 15:26:34'),(71,'B MEENAKSHI SUNDARAM','1987-02-01','Male','INDIAN','sundaram.research@gmail.com','C-5, ESIC STAFF QUARTERS,\r\n143, STERLING ROAD,\r\nNUNGAMBAKKAM,\r\nCHENNAI','600034','Chennai','Tamil Nadu','04428213366','c/o.

The possibility of traveling through worm holes, the possibility of finding higher intelligent species in the universe, the possibility of an entire universe made of anti-matter, getting to know about higher dimensions and trying to visualize them. All these stuffs simply blow my mind. The beautiful auroras of the poles, the gigantic super novas happening up there, the millions of stars in the sky invite me on a quest to know more. There are many questions left unanswered, many stuffs yet to be discovered. I believe, astronomy and astrophysics could answer ultimate questions of life like, why we are here? How we came into existence? Astronomy and astrophysics humbles me, it is my dream. Sometimes even while reading about astronomy, makes my hair on my hand stand upright and makes me transfixed and speechless for a while. \r\nAs I kid, I guess like many other kids I always liked stars. During my 4th grade or so, I came to know of black holes, that captivated me and my interest for physics grew. During my 9th grade I read Dan Browns the Angels and Demons where they hypothetically create some kind of bomb using anti-matter, I googled and learnt a bit about anti-matter, that truly left me spell bound. I could only appreciate the grand design with which the universe has been flawlessly designed. My interest for physics grew and I read A brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking. I started reading his follow up The Grand Design, but didnt complete it then. Never the less the books had a serious impact on my life, I wanted to pursue astrophysics for my career. Since I did not have a clear knowledge of the various colleges in India that offered Astrophysics I opted for ECE at MEPCO.\r\nDuring my college days, EMF and Radio frequency somehow linked me to astrophysics. Massachusetts Institute of Technologys Open courseware on Electricity and Magnetism by Walter Lewin accelerated my liking towards EMF.I started reading Cosmos by Carl Sagan.

I am also a regular reader of Scientific American,the articles that I come across on the magazine kept inspiring me. \r\n\r\nOnline articles, videos(TEDx, Big Think,space.com ) and open course wares (MIT OCW)  by eminent physicists like Dr.Michio Kaku kept inspiring me and drew me closer and closer to astronomy and astrophysics.

Attending the 5th Science Conclave at IIIT Allahabad and interacting with J.V.Narlikar sir and other great scientists inspired me to read more on astrophysics. In May2013 I attented the Summer School on Astrophysics at Kodaikanal Solar Observatory organised by Indian Institue of Astrophysics,Banglore made me realize that doing research on Astrophysics and unravelling the mystries of the universe and taking India to greater heights in d field of Astronomy and Astrophysics is what I want to do in my life.\r\nThe lectures by scientists at the Summer school boosted greatly my interest in Astrophysics mainly in theoretical and observational.

I have read several books by top physicists and have tried to understand the technical aspects of physics by going through General Relativity, String Theory, Stellar Physics, Quantum Physics, and other related subjects. I always aspired to be a physicist and despite my slight detour, i am determined to pursue astrophysics now.','No',NULL,'Theory, Observations, Computation','Pursuing astrophysics was my passion ever since i was big enough to think. Growing up i always used to look up in the night sky and ponder. So much was my enthusiasm and curiosity that i was named \"The question box\" of the family. In the early periods my father used to tell me little as he was from an economics background. While in high school i asked myself \"What would you see in the mirror if you were travelling at the speed of light?\" which later on i knew was the question in Young Einsteins Mind. Further i also created a constant based on the speed of light (childishly) that would tell us how near to the present we can actually observe. i was introduced to special theory of relativity by my maths teacher and i was fascinated by it. So much that i actually could not perform well in semester exams at the time. There was a book on relativity which gave me the technical end of Special Relativity, Electromagnetism, Tensor Analysis and General Relativity, some of which i could grasp and others like tensor went over my head. But now i had a somewhat technical idea of the subject and this was even more fascinating. While at the end of my high school i came in touch with - \"Concepts of Modern Physics\" by Arthur Beiser. It was beautiful to actually understand the world of quantum physics and to know regarding the schrodingers equation, origin of shape of orbitals, Particle in a box hypothesis, The quantum tunneling effect, and the related paradoxes. This was the treasure of knowledge i was looking for my entire life. I pursued the Modern Physics book by Beiser till my graduation, although it was very little help with my graduation course. After completion if my engineering i had an offer from Accenture at hand. I never wanted to join IT but due to the financial condition at home i had to take a break from studies. I worked in accenture for three years with great work record and have served various multinational companies. But my heart was always in the stars. I followed news by the international astrophysics community, NASA, ESA, etc and got to know regarding the recent developments on  WMAP, Higgs Boson, Voyager 1, The new Double Slit Experiment results, Quantum Computing, among other things. The international physics community is on a peak high adrenaline with all the newly found researches and observations, the weird new twists in our understanding of the universe and the fascinating boundaries that Hubble space telescope has breached and i want in. Leading my job in IT while my heart was set in astrophysics was painfully exhausting. I was leading a dual life especially because i neither pursued my career properly nor did i get the time to pursue my hobby properly which was in astrophysics. Thus i finally decided to be true to my passion and pursue a career in astrophysics.','Yes. I have carried out various support projects in the  field of Enterprise Resource Planning while working in Accenture. The projects were specifically support based on the System Application and Products (SAP) software specially in the field of Supply Chain Management (SCM) for the Production Planning Sub-module. Apart from this i did a research based project for the Video Data Analysis (VDAS) Lab to develop a code to integrate image processing inside a tracking program at Electro-Optical Tracking Division (EOTD) inside the Integrated Test Range (ITR) in Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO), Chandipur. In addition to this i have worked on additional projects on MATLAB and JAVA-3D to design different software for image recognition and Rubicks Cube puzzle solving technique in my college. I have worked on report writings, managed issues, developed codes, and basically have a mainstream idea of working in a project with other teammates. \r\n','Participated and won till semi finals in \"Bharat ke 8\" the North East quiz show hosted by Derek O Brian, which was aired on Sony Television in 2003.

I had to basically work with currently developing system, where the main advantage is broader bandwidth. Although formally the project was titled as testing of receiver systems , instrumental hustles were leveraged by analytical challenges since I was from Physics background rather than a technical one. Apart from knowing the very basics of observational features in interferometric mode what I had learned is how something significant can be done in very simple but elegant way. ','Theory, Observations, Computation','Fascination is similar to laws and facts of nature which are beyond satisfactory reasoning and derivation. A humble undergraduate yet to have tasted the rigorous and vivid world of Astronomy and Astrophysics can opt for the same based on inevitable attraction at best.                                                                                     \r\n	But, there must be incidents behind the purpose of specific interest, stimulating passion as well as ensuring the right way followed hitherto.  \r\n	In my very childhood pictures of astronomical observations, launching of space-telescopes and artificial satellites and journey of mankind to space were world of fantasy. That the bare sky and seemingly ordinary events happening there I can see in naked eyes might have a deeper philosophy is no more than an absolute surprise. Interest in Astronomy grew as a natural curiosity to certain things devoid of the tiniest idea that those are in fact the business in the regime of the same.\r\n	When formalisms in various dimensions of Physics started to haunt and ideas of Astrophysics were begun to be presented by means of informal colloquiums at a compatible level in parallel, it seemed to be, to the best of my knowledge, an autonomous stream with its own flavor rather than being a mere specialization in Physics, where principles of different branches of Physics can be applied accordingly. \r\n 	Although it is quite tough to identify whether interest and expertise resonate at all. It needs a kind of verification just like scientific experiments in general. An academic tour to research institutes followed by shower of lectures and trip to real observatories ( I came to IUCAA last February and was taken to GMRT and IGO thereafter) had enhanced a lot, whereas the experience of summer internship on radio astronomy has almost assured to maintain this inertia. \r\nIt is impossible to get inclined to a particular area of theory, observation or computation from a very general background. Still I am prone to mainly observations, which seem to trigger curiosities at the fundamental level.\r\nAll what remains to be said is what features have enthralled me most. To me, it is the best tool to interprete and explore the vastness, depth and fate (?) of cosmos. What it deals with are space and time, the omnipresent entities-- as well as matter and radiation, the whole of universe. And to resolve mysteries it hunts for latest probes ; from electromagnetic spectrum to gravitational wave and neutrinos.In a nutshell, it is the largest region of interest as universe contains everything!  ','In the summer of 2013, I had done an informal project with Professor Somak Raychaudhury on detection of extra-solar planets by transit method. I had gone through the basic theory behind the process and also the possible limitations appearing in practical situations. I had tried simple formulation of the equations and minimization of errors arising both from ignoring special cases which could have happened surrounding the region being observed and/or imperfectness of the instruments and the way they are getting controlled. Data extracted from Kepler mission of NASA was used to work with.\r\nLast Summer I had done a short-term project at GMRT which have already been stated. Here my aim was to compare currently working GSB system with developing GWB  \r\nin all aspects possible, to state by which precision and accuracy GWB will outperform GSB ; by means of observational data taken in interferometric mode.

Mathematics always interested me, right from my school days and this prompted me to take up science after my secondary examinations.Engineering was a natural choice after that since I was always more interested in applications rather than learning the underlying fundamentals only.During my 2nd year of study I came to be acquainted with the fundamentals of Applied Electromagnetics and this interested me a lot.This was further boosted when I started learning Antenna Theory in my 5th semester.The mathematical rigor of the subject was an added bonus since mathematics had always been my favourite. I was greatly fascinated by the numerous different types of antennas and their varied field of applications.What caught my fascination most was the parabolic dish antenna and its varied applications in satellite communication, deep space communication and more importantly radio astronomy and the mapping of the universe.This is what first prompted me to seriously think of taking up astronomy in general and astronomical instrumentation &amp; radio astronomy in particular as my future field of graduate study. NCRA &amp; IUCAA being two of the leading institutes of international repute in India for research in Astronomy, securing a graduate position here would be a huge leap towards my ultimate goal to gain knowledge and excel in this field. I am open minded to a variety of different fields within Physics, and am both interested and excited to experience new and different concepts, and to broaden my understanding of some of concepts I am interested in.

I believe, to be an astrophysicist is the only thing for which I came to the existence. To be fortunate enough I was born in the vicinity of ?The Lonar Lake?, the world only salt water lake in basaltic rock.  My fascination of the universe began from the age I started hearing stories about Lonar lake. In my leisure time I use to go to the lake to understand the reason behind it.  Being curious at mind I use to gaze at starts at night and use to explore school library having article about Lonar lake for hours and hours. This keeps building my interest in astrophysics.\r\nA desire to explore the unknown has plunged further perhaps through glimpses of foreign countries and cultures. During my visit to Dubai, I went to an event organized by Caf?  Scintifique, where anyone can come and explore the latest ideas in science and technology. Here I went through series of presentations which were discussing about, How big is the observable universe? What is it made of? What lies beyond it? Was there a time before the Big Bang? Could space have unseen dimensions? This event stimulus my curious mind about those questions. After this when I saw ?The Geminid? meteor shower my me believe to be an astrophysicist strengthen further.\r\n\r\nThe zeal to learn more about cosmos I have done MSc Physics from Amravati University. This degree has given me a direction to deal with my curious mind. I have also done my B.Ed from Amravati University, which helped to enhance my teaching skills. I have also done Post Graduate Diploma in Business Administration, from IIMS, Pune. This course given me the skill of problem solving. Apart from this I have 2 years of experience as a HR at Arsh Management Consultants, Pune, which has enhance my analytical thinking.\r\n\r\nFinally, I believe that I am a well-rounded student but at the same time I have a great interest and curiosity at the subject of astrophysics. My analytical skills can break down any theories of physics until I understand every aspect of them. Also my interests beside physics will help me adapt in the university.

For this they have always looked to Sky. The book and the TV series Cosmos by Carl Sagan have greatly invoked in me to study the Universe at large. Looking at the cloudless sky I am amazed by the vastness of the Cosmos. As an amateur HAM radio user I have encountered large amount of radio noises. From where are these noises coming from? How long have been these unknown signals existed?  These and other questions have lingered in my mind from my youth.

At that time, i had a very limited knowledge, to explain the questions that arose in my mind . As I grew up, I started questioning myself, why study of the phenomenon going on in the outer space so much important and how these can even affect life on earth ,moreover I was fascinated by the fact ,that it is not that astronomy and astrophysics has emerged as a scientific field in recent years but its roots can be traced in the most ancient civilizations. Throughout history ,humans have  looked at the sky to navigate the vast oceans, to decide when to plant their crops and to answer questions of where we came from and where we are going. The time when Copernicus claimed that the earth was not the centre of the universe, it triggered a revolution through which religion, science and society had to adapt with the new world view.\r\nWhen I was a little girl, I used to look at the night sky, and be captivated by the vastness, but felt very small compared to the grand creation. I frequently questioned my importance in the universe. But soon this dilemma was swept aside when i became aware that the basic elements that are found in the stars are the same elements that make up our bodies, or any object, no matter how big or small. This realization had a big impact on my life, as for the first time I felt connected with the cosmos.\r\nBut as I slowly came in terms with the present world around us, which is faced by many immediate problems ,such as hunger ,poverty ,energy ,global warming ,violence ,discrimination  and many more, immediately it strikes to the consciousness  that how astronomy and astrophysics is relevant in solving this problems that is hugely affecting human life on earth.\r\nI thought that astronomy and astrophysics is the science which have influenced in many ways the lifestyle of civilizations in the past, most of primitive developments in this field was primarily done to fulfill the very basic needs,like planting crops or finding the right geographical place for the survival of a tribe. But the present day problems we are facing are much more complex, and need more foolproof solutions. To find reliable solutions, research is going on throughout the world. But research can be slow work, its hardly ever about eureka moments in the bath. Research needs precision, tenacity, dedication.  \r\nAstronomy is one of the few scientific fields that interacts directly with society. Not only transcending borders, but actively promoting collaborations around the world. Moreover, astronomy and astrophysics is such a subject which seeks knowledge from many other field of science like fluid dynamics, classical mechanics, quantum mechanics,non linear dynamics,general relativity and many more. It helps me join the dots between different fields of science and how they are interconnected which each other.\r\n','i did a summer project at HRI under Dr, Tapas Kumar Das,during the period of 22st june,2014 to 11th august ,2014. \r\nmy project was focussed on the analytical and the computational aspects of astrophysical fluid dynamics in general,putting emphasis on spherically symmetric bondi accretion onto a newtonian point mass.','CBSE merit scholarship for single girl child(class xth standard),(class xii th standard)and(B.Sc. 1st,2nd,3rd year).','','No','Rejected','No','No','2014-09-01 11:02:44'),(132,'VAIBHAV','1990-05-08','Male','INDIAN','vyadav329@gmail.com','1039/a shivaji nagar near mata mandir thatipur gwalior mp','474011','Gwalior','Madhya Pradesh','07512341683','1039/a shivaji nagar near mata mandir thatipur gwalior mp','474011','Gwalior','Madhya Pradesh','OBC','Xth Std','10+2 school','MP Board',2005,'',56,'XIIth Std','10+2 school','MP Board',2007,'',50,'B.E.','SRIIT Gwalior','RGPV BHOPAL',2012,'',70,'NULL','','',0,'',0,'B.E and IT Branch','2012','Sukhbhan Singh Yadav, is my father and position is the principal of the mp govt.','jagriti yadav, is my sister and position is the senior lecturer in physics is the mp govt.','I am completed the BE degree in december 2012. and this next year 2013 are join the gate exam preparation and take gate exam feb 2014 in gwalior center.','No',NULL,'Computation','The astronomy and space science are very intersted subject in my life and this subject are the study of the BE first and sceond year in engineering physics and engineering electreonics sub.

As I have learnt, during the initial period, the universe was very hot and energetic, that no particles could have ever existed. And all the forces were unified as a single force. Gradually, this unified force split into different forces including the gravitational force.Now a question that often comes to my mind is \"How these forces come into existence or why did it happen?\" And howcome there is gravitational force inside the sun even,keeping the planets in place, just like our parents? Whereas the sun is just a huge ball of fire, having helium particles in it, spitting fire like an angry dragon.\r\n  The universe is expanding.The big bang theory is the world over accepted theory for development of universe.My doubt is how does the universe expand?I sit just like the expanding balloon, when we fill in air?If it is the same concept, then what makes the universe to expand? It is a very common misconcept that big bang describes the origin of universe.The big bang theory explains how the universe developed from a very small dense state.Most people, including me believed that Big bang is an explosion, leading to the origin of universe.Further looking deep down into the concept, I came to the conclusion that most of the laws of science are not obeyed.I have learnt during my schooling that all the particles obey the laws of science to perfection.Thus the concept on which the Big bang works contradicts our ideology.How is it possible? I have many such doubts prevailing in my mind. \r\n    I have subscribed to Universe today, for the purpose of clearing all my doubts.It sends me an email everyday,about the everyday happenings in universe. I recently came to know that Indias first interplanetary voyager MOM is going to reach Mars within 25 days. The moment it reaches, India will be one of the four elite nations studying the surface of the red planet. I am eagerly waiting for September 24, when this wonder would be taking place.MOM i.e. Mars Orbitter Mission has been prepared by the ISRO engineers. MOMs main mission is the demonstration of technological capabilities, although she will also be studying the red planets surface and atmosphere.I am very eager to know about the nature of mars, if it is similar to our earth or not?\r\n   I am still doing my T.Y. BSc, but I wish to join one of the reputed institutions for my Phd course. And it is also my great desire to work for ISRO. If I get a chance to go into space and explore it, I would never decline such an oppurtunity. So recently I am concentrating completely on my studies, so that I can achieve all I wish for.

It is a discipline that opens our eyes, gives context to our place in the Universe and that can reshape how we see the world. Astronomy has always had a significant impact on our world view. Early cultures identified celestial objects with the gods and took their movements across the sky as prophecies of what was to come. We would now call this astrology, far removed from the hard facts and expensive instruments of todays astronomy, but there are still hints of this history in modern astronomy. \r\nThere are still many unanswered questions in astronomy. Current research is struggling to understand questions like: How old are we?, What is the fate of the Universe? and possibly the most interesting: How unique is the Universe, and could a slightly different Universe ever have supported life? But astronomy is also breaking new records every day, establishing the furthest distances, most massive objects, highest temperatures and most violent explosions. Although we live in a world faced with the many immediate problems of hunger, poverty, energy and global warming, we argue that astronomy has long term benefits that are equally as important to a civilized society. Several studies have told us that investing in science education, research and technology provides a great return  not only economically, but culturally and indirectly for the population.\r\nAstronomy is one of the few scientific fields that interacts directly with society. Not only transcending borders, but actively promoting collaborations around the world.\r\nOn a personal level, I certainly want to be an explorer rather than becoming a robotic worker in other companies.','','','I have attended the GATE-2013.

Astronomy has always been my passion since my childhood. I started looking at the pictures in astronomy books before I could even read. The pictures were beautiful,fascinating and intriguing. As I grew up I wanted to know all about what those pictures meant.Astronomy is a science that seeks to explain everything that we observe in the Universe,from the comets and planets in our own solar system to distant galaxies to the echoes of the Big Bang. By studying the cosmos beyond our own planet,we can understand where we came from,where we are going,why is the universe organized as it is?Are we alone? And how physics works under conditions which are impossible to recreate on Earth. In astronomy,the Universe is our laboratory! Astronomy provides an example of an alternative approach to the scientific method- observation,simulation,and theory. It is an enjoyable,inexpensive hobby for millions of people- the naturalists of the night. But above all astronomy has shown us how insignificant the human physical existence is,and how great the human mind with an intelligence that is now embracing a dazzling range of phenomena,from the astronomically large to the infinitely small. I have very little doubt that what astronomy will still give us in the future will dwarf all of its past contributions by comparison. I am motivated by curiosity and a deep desire to understand some of the grandest and most beautiful phenomena in the universe,as well as a desire to share these wonders with others. To me, research is often a bridge to an ambitious goal - a bridge that needs to be crossed in steps. Astrophysics strike me as one of the most exciting areas of research today. Thanks to new observations,better methods and more powerful simulations that we can now hope to answer,with reasonable confidence,some of the most profound questions ever raised.Astronomy has emerged forever from the old books of mythology to assert itself as an exact science,an unclouded crystal ball of the universe. I would like to be a part of it. Thank You.','Yes it was not project but national conference of ISRO that was organized in our college.

My desire to study Astrophysics has developed from spending hours of my life gazing up at the stars.\r\nI have always enjoyed trying to find out how things work and why they work that way and it gives a big relief to my nerves. When I was younger it was mechanical but as I grew older the emphasis shifted to more scientific explanations. I completed my Engineering graduation from Electrical and Electronics Engineering and it gave me a vast knowledge of how things work and why they actually exist. It enthralled me and encouraged me to read and lap up information of the universe and all aspects of the subject. As A level with a better understanding of physics I just want to explore more so that I can get answer to a very basic question how this universe works and why we exist. \r\nI enjoy sports, I play Basketball and has a keen interest in Music Theory also I play Guitar &amp; Mouthorgan.

In addition to this I also try to keep up-to-date with the whole  Technological advancements in the recent global electronics.\r\nThough I havent had any big achievements in my life as I was not so good in studies in my early years but later on I started enjoying things and it worked for me my motto of life is to have knowledge in every field of life so that I can explain to upcoming younger generation very precisely in layman terms about the concepts of astronomy rather than making it a rocket science , as I believe to expand our horizon from earth to intergalactic level we need to make the pro scientific theories and concepts like this  so that students can interestingly read them and think about them again and again so that when they start their graduation they are forty fathom forward from the todays scientists community and that requires a lot of work and interesting interactive approach of a person rather than being conventional as the world is changing so why cant we. \r\n	Also I seek a big life changing experience at IUCAA I hope my approach towards science and astronomy is excellent and I can have any advantage in life based on this.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nSudhanshu Vijayvargia\r\n','The project is designed to implement FACTS by TSR (Thyristor Switch Reactance). This method is used either when charging the transmission line or when there is very low load at the receiving end.\r\nDue to very low or no load, very low current flows through the transmission line and shunt capacitance in the transmission line becomes dominant. This causes voltage amplification (Ferranti Effect) due to which receiving end voltage may become double than the sending ends voltage (generally in case of very long transmission lines). To compensate this, shunt inductors are automatically connected across the transmission line.\r\nFurther the project can be enhanced by using firing angle control methodology for smooth control of the voltage. Thus, this is better than switching reactors in steps where voltage control (also in steps) is not very precise.\r\n','','','No','Rejected','No','No','2014-09-03 20:14:25'),(205,'FARAN','1993-03-06','Male','INDIAN','faran11me28@gmail.com','75/2 UTTAR DARWAZA, RAILWAY STATION ROAD , RAEBARELI','229001','Rae Bareli','Uttar Pradesh','09045190470','M.J.P ROHILKHAND UNIVERSITY, BAREILLY','243006','Bareilly','Uttar Pradesh','General','Xth Std','NATIONAL INTER COLLEGE','U.P BOARD',2009,'',59,'XIIth Std','NATIONAL INTER COLLEGE','U.P BOARD',2011,'',77,'B.Tech.','M.J.P ROHILKHAND UNIVERSITY','M.J.P.R.U',2015,'',74,'NULL','N/A','',0,'',0,'B.TECH 6th Sem (MECHANICAL ENGINEERING)','2015','Dr. T.U SIDDIQUE','Mr. VISHAL SAXENA','','No',NULL,'Theory, Observations, Computation','I want to try my best in astronomy, because i m interested in dark energy, dark matter, pulsar, quarser, and their relative phenomenon with expansion of universe and big bang theory.

Other important thing are how our galaxy is formed (i.e big band concept) and black hole formations and many other things are deeply studied and understanded in astronomy field only.','','','QUALIFIED THE GRADUATE APPTITUDE TEST FOR ENGINEERING(GATE-2013)  WITH A GATE SCORE OF 377.','No','Rejected','No','No','2014-09-04 00:13:24'),(211,'samir mondal','1986-06-05','Male','indian','apanriday@gmail.com','ju salt lake campus hostel,room no-s6-01,salt lake .sector-3,kolkata 700098,west bengal','700098','kolkata','West Bengal','033-525698','kalyani university,kalyani nadia,west bengal','741235','kalyani','West Bengal','SC/ST','Xth Std','sreepally p.n nath high school','w.b.b.s.e',2002,'1st',80,'XIIth Std','chakdaha ramlal academy','w.b.c.h.s.e',2004,'1st',67,'B.Sc.','chakdaha college','kalyani university',2009,'2nd',52,'M.Sc.','kalyani university','kalyani university',2011,'2nd',56,'post bsc b.tech in instrumentation and electronics engineering','2015','tapas majumder,professor indepartment of physics,university of kalyani.','a shinha,professor in physics department,ku.','I have complited my msc in physics with electronics special paper .After that i joined in jadavpur university to study post bsc btech in instrumentation and electronics engineering.i am in final year of that course.i have average scgpa 7.3 out of 10 scale.','No',NULL,'Observations','when in msc i study cosmology as a subject then tit was a very interesting  topic for me.i like to know and explore universe.As application of physics in instrumentation engineering when i started to read instrumentation subject(mainly process instrumentation ) i knew about different type of sensor and devices which can measure many parameters.

Astronomy and Astrophysics and quantum physics are the main branches of physics which interests me a lot. \r\nAstronomy is a science that seeks to explain everything that we observe in the Universe, from the comets and planets in our own solar system to distant galaxies. By studying the cosmos beyond our own planet, we can understand where we came from, where we are going, and how physics works under conditions which are impossible to recreate on Earth. In astronomy, the Universe is our laboratory.\r\nI am looking forward to establish my career as bright young astrophysicists and ponder the nature of the planets, stars, galaxies, and the Universe.

It helps us to analysis and study the data taken during the observation, how using a simple program we develop our understanding of universe. In modern astronomy and astrophysics, computation is an important tool. But what attracts me more is the theory behind these observations and analysis. In order to understand these observations better we develop theory that further modifies our model and help us to understand the universe in better way. And universe cannot be understand without understanding space and time and how they came into existence; What happened at very beginning and what makes universe look the way it looks now; what is going to happen next.

Though I am not much of a writer or poet so I cannot explain simple things in spellbinding manner, but I am just a very patient one who can sit and watch and at the end of every night try to put together the puzzles of sky. Logically there are two aspects of interest and both of them lead to a childlike mentality, one is which when you look at sky for hours waiting to catch a glimpse of single meteor and the other one is when you decide to bring in your own thoughts, the second one makes you feel just like a grown child, because in the end you cannot deny the data and mathematics. \r\nIt is not wrong to admit that I am also among those who are fascinated by the black holes, supernovae, stellar workings, life, origin and time. But the physical reality can only be understood by experimenting and postulating, sometimes naively. In every individuals life there comes a time when one ponders about the questions of life, origin and beginning, some try music, religion etc. I believe in some and in some I cannot but, I can study and experiment with few hence ultimately I can feel that my understanding has improved. \r\nI cannot write a single paragraph about why I observe Moon every time it is in the sky, when with naked eye it is for a child with only eyes and when with telescope it is for the child with opinion and a lot of questions.\r\nThe final few things are very simple, I cannot make you understand what I feel inside when I am looking at Orion nebula (except I will not move away from the scope till I am satisfied) but I will definitely tell you what I can calculate and deduce. So I wont trying explaining whether I like the symmetry or color in the deep space images but surely I can assure you one thing, that I want to be the one who captures those images. There is a time when out of those grainy seemingly chaotic stack of images I get a brilliant glimpse of what is out there. At times like these you realize that gathering a spectra is of much more importance. So that simply means I want to do scientific analysis, as I love the information and knowledge I can deduce from data. \r\nOne main question arises is this if I just want to understand the working of universe then why to do it in an academic institute, why not in some philosophically isolated manner.  The answer is very easy, it is far more logical to study a group of bodies and assign behavior to them in scientifically devised manner rather than assuming their pictorial description. This simply means I have to analyze the scientific data rather than watching the sky and paint it on a canvas. \r\n\r\n','I am very well experienced in observational and spectroscopical astronomy and astrophotography, i did this for most of the duration of my masters programme. I have imaged various planets and many prominent deep space objects. Pinnacle of my work was imaging the comet ISON. Spectroscopy of the Sun,many standard stars and nebulae was also done, this also include one very detailed study of earthshine. The equipments used are 11 inch Schmidt Cassegrain telescope, SBIG CCD ST 402 camera and SBIG DSS7 spectrograph. For planetary images i have used Celestron Neximage, apart from that i have worked with many optical filters.\r\nIn my final semester of M.Sc. i also did a project where i studied the effect of Sn on optical properties of Se-Te system. Here i used thin film samples and did there fabrication and XRD and UV-VIS-NIR spectroscopy. From spectroscopic data i calculated parameters required for finding the results.\r\n','2013- IAPT NSSP, Dept. of Physics, Panjab University, Chandigarh, Feb 2013, presented a poster on flexi-sensors.\r\n2012- E-Quiz conducted at P.G.G.C.G.

I came to IUCAA as a Summer School student in 2014, which gave me the exposure to the ongoing research work in the various frontiers of astrophysics, about our current understanding of the universe, and the unsolved problems.  \r\n\r\nToday Astronomy is one of the most dynamic fields in physics- everyday something new is being discovered, old theories and ideas are constantly being challenged by fresh data, and that makes astronomy a really exciting field to work in. And as more data is obtained from ongoing experiments, and bigger telescopes like TMT on the verge of installation, and newer methods of probe like Gravitational Waves, one can only expect this trend to continue, perhaps with more vigor, in the coming years. \r\n\r\nI am interested in the following areas of astronomy-\r\n\r\n1. Unsolved problems in theoretical physics- Baryon asymmetry is one of the most fundamental and challenging problems in theoretical physics today, and is something that I am really interested to work on. Dark matter is generally expected to be weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) but the many experiments that are under operation today have yet been unable to detect them. Similarly dark energy till today has remained out of comprehension beyond the fact that it can be represented as Cosmological constant, and we need physical understanding of the phenomenon. All these questions have the potential of deeply impacting our present ideas and understanding of the universe.\r\n\r\n2. Accretion disk physics- As a mechanical engineering student I have studied fluid mechanics and its applications in engineering problems in great detail, and I am naturally inclined to astrophysical systems that involve substantial fluid modeling. As a summer school student at IUCAA, my reading project under Dr. Gulab Dewangan was on X-ray binary systems, during which I got acquainted with the theoretical models developed on the structure and dynamics of accretion disks. They are associated with the most energetic and exotic events observable in the universe, and a more detailed understanding of them is required. This problem intrigues me very much because a deep understanding of fluid dynamics has eluded the scientific community for centuries now, and astrophysical systems like the accretion disks can be a good place to search for answers.   \r\n\r\n3. Instrumentation- After the completion of Summer School at IUCAA, I stayed back and under Dr. A.N. Ramprakash worked on Stress Mirror Polishing technique used to grind and polish mirrors of segmented telescopes like Keck and TMT, and I am continuing the work as my final year engineering project. I wish to use my engineering skills in the design and development of astronomical devices during my career.\r\n\r\nAstronomy is going through very interesting times, I want to be part of the movement by getting involved in the search for the answers to the most fundamental questions about the universe. \r\n','1.

I did not realize it until my graduation days. I completed my graduation in Electronics but as soon as I realized that my star gazing hobby was not just a childish admiration but the result of my deep interest and never ending curiosity about this fascinating universe and the physics associated with it, I changed my course to physics. And it really turned out to be a highly satisfactory decision. I was warned by people around me that a change in the branch would make you repent but that was the time of my life when everything was crystal clear in front of my eyes, I knew either I could chase my dream with full determination else wonder my entire life what if. So I followed my dream and here I am, completely satisfied with what I chose. I did face some difficulties in the beginning but a taste of hard work was provided to this critical situation and the result came out to be pretty good. Observing and analyzing the heavenly objects using computational methods is my primary area of interest although I do like to have more and more theoretical knowledge also about this vastly tangled and amazingly incredible universe. The inexplicable beauty of all the laws and principles our magnificent universe relies upon have always fascinated me. Whenever I see a picture of any celestial body, star clusters, supernova explosions, nebulae, galaxies etc, to be very honest, I get lost for sometime in the world of my imagination wondering about all the baffling mysteries of the universe we live in. I do believe in the quote by Einstein- Imagination is more important than knowledge and it makes me wonder even more about these queries. The questions- What lies beyond our range of vision, Do the universe have a beginning and an end and what lies beyond and after that, How can such an enormously large structure follow symmetries and laws, etc are some of the points which have baffled minds of every human being and mine too. It might sound stupid but sometimes I wish that before I die we get to know these secrets else I would not be able to rest in peace. It is just that this space stuff means a lot to me and I want to dedicate my entire life to make some contribution towards such field. In conclusion, I can assure that I have the ability and the determination to achieve the dream I am chasing if provided the right opportunity and I do hope that I would be given a fair chance to realize my objectives.','I worked as a summer intern under the guidance of Dr. Harvinder Kaur Jassal (Assistant Professor Physics, IISER Mohali, India) on topic General Relativity and Structure Formation in the Universe. It was a theoretical work. The basics of General Relativity and the tensor formulation to carry out the necessary mathematics were learnt. Also the essential base of cosmology was studied which including topics like The Cosmological Principle, Hubble?s law, FRW Metric etc.\r\nDuring my Masters I worked under the supervision of Dr. P.

Viewing night sky has also been very fascinating and intriguing. I was always interested in Astrophysics, but it was during my 1st year of B.Sc that I got to attend a seminar of Dr. D.P. Duari, which interested me more towards Astrophysics.\r\nThe Universe is our laboratory in Astronomy. Astronomy helps us to understand where we came from and where we are going. I am highly motivated by curiosity and a large desire to understand some of the most beautiful phenomena in the Universe and also to share these with others. \r\nAstrophysics is one of the most exciting areas of research today. Thanks to the better theories, powerful simulations and new observatories which has helped it to emerge from the old books of mythology to an exact science, with a crystal clear view of the Universe to a large extent. \r\nIt is quite fascinating to even imagine that by looking far away in space,we can penetrate far  back in time , because the light from distant objects took a long time to reach us.\r\nI have done a reading project at IUCAA under Prof. Kanak Saha on The Formation of Nuclei of Galaxies Through Dynamical Friction. I am really interested to study in detail one other important application of the concept of dynamical friction- Formation and Evolution of Binary Black Holes.\r\nSince most galaxies contain black holes at their centers, it is natural to ask what happens to the black holes when a satellite galaxy merges with a larger host. As the orbit of the satellite decays, its stars are stripped by tidal forces that become stronger and stronger as the orbit shrinks until only its central black hole is left  behind. The orbit of  this black hole continues to  decay due to dynamical friction. Finally this black hole and the black hole at the center of the host   galaxy  will form a  bound  binary system.   After the black  hole  binary is  formed, its  orbit continues to decay due to dynamical friction. I am really eager to gain further  knowledge and  hence  continue my research work on the dynamics of this  binary  system.\r\nAstronomy allows us to apply the laws of nature under far more extreme conditions of temperature, pressure and energies. It also helps us to understand the relation between space and time. This is undoubtedly The Golden Age of Astronomy. There lies great scope for unprecedented progress in our understanding of the nature of celestial objects.\r\nMy one month stay at IUCAA for The Introductory Summer School in Astronomy and Astrophysics has highly motivated me and has enhanced my desire and enthusiasm towards Astronomy and Astrophysics to a large extent. Thank you.\r\n  ','1.I have attended the Introductory Summer School n Astronomy and Astrophysics and completed a group project on The Formation of Nuclei of Galaxies Through Dynamical Friction under the guidance of Prof. Kanak Saha.\r\n2.

I also became a part of the astro-particle tea, a colloquium series held in my university. It was organized only to have discussions about astrophysics and astronomy. I thoroughly enjoyed it and specially some discussions regarding Quasars and Spectroscopy kept a mark in my mind.

I always have been inquiring to know and understand all the mysteries that the world above us is brimming with. However the scope for a formal and deterministic answers has remained elusive as there was very little chance presented during my school days. Therefore I turned to popular science books such as Universe in a nutshell and At the speed of light. These were definitely informative and entertaining; however they still lacked the rigor that only a formal study can provide. Therefore I wish for a more comprehensive and more thorough knowledge on this wonderful subject. I believe the best chance for me to pursue my dream would be through TIFR, NCRA-TIFR and IUCAA only. All my life I have been   hoping for such a chance and am truly grateful for that. If given the chance I will be only grateful towards dedicating myself towards pushing the boundary on the limits of our knowledge base.

From  then onwards, various questions on the details of the universe haunted me. That inspied me at a tender age to take up research in astronomy as a dream career. Fascination for this branch of physics  actually grew stronger after getting admitted in Presidency University. There we had regular  seminars  and talks every week on various  topics on astrophysics and cosmology given by eminent scientists , and the various cutting edge research topics are discussed. They also encourage students to give short presentations on various topics , so all that actually  helped me to grow acquaintance with some parts of astrophysics  and help me develop a strong interest. I attended the TCGC-ER (Topical conference on gravitation and cosmology)  held in august this year . Besides,  I was very fortunate to celebrate this years (2014)NATIONAL  SCIENCE  WEEK  in IUCAA and Ncra tifr along with some other fellow classmate of mine of presidency university(accompanied by Prof. Somak roychoudhuri). I got to attend lectures by some renowned astrophysicisists and scientists like J.V.narlikar, Dipankar  bhattarchaya, thanu padmanabhan, sri anand, ranjeev mishra and several others. Their  lectures, their  words of encouragement, their simple explanations of some complicated phenomenons of the universe actually encouraged me more. We got to see  The giant meterwave telescopes(GMRT), optical telescopes , and understand their mechanisms ,all these actually increased my thirst for knowledge to a substantial amount.\r\nI think the particular thing I like about astrophysics is the fact that it is mainly based on observational science(that is definitely very much exciting). We can observe, collect data, analyse them and then come up with some good theories satisfying the observational phenomena and can be one step closer to knowing the universe a better way. \r\n','Last summer, I started to work on a research project with Dr. Ritaban Chatterjee at Presidency University. Initially, I studied the physics of synchrotron radiation, including emitted power, spectrum, and the effect of relativistic beaming from the textbooks by Rybicki &amp; Lightman, and Malcom Longair. After that, I was asked to calculate how a power-law distribution of relativistic electrons would evolve with time if it were radiating energy only through the synchrotron process. I have recently finished that and currently working on a similar time evolution problem where a constant source of high-energy electrons is present while I continue to learn more details of high-energy radiative processes from those books. I plan to study the time variability of synchrotron and inverse-Compton emission from relativistic jets of quasars and compare some theoretical results with gamma-ray light curves of blazars from the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope and supporting multi-wavelength data.','Upto Secondary examinations, I received many awards and prizes  in school for consistently good academic records.\r\n Presently I am getting INSPIRE scholarship 2011 from Ministry of science and technology, government of India.','N/A',NULL,'Selected','No','No','2014-09-06 20:48:34'),(268,'REHAN KHAN','1992-09-04','Male','INDIA','rehankhan94186@gmail.com','HOLY HOME, TOP FLOOR, NEAR GANJU NIWAS, NEAR MONAL PUBLIC SCHOOL,\r\nSANJAULI, SHIMLA-6','171006','SHIMLA*','Himachal Pradesh','09418671467','HIMACHAL PRADESH UNIVERSITY, SUMMER HILL, SHIMLA- 171005','171005','SHIMLA*','Himachal Pradesh','General','Xth Std','DAV PUBLIC SCHOOL, NEW SHIMLA','CBSE',2008,'A',78,'XIIth Std','CHAPSLEE PUBLIC SCHOOL','CBSE',2010,'A',68,'B.Tech.','LR INSTITUTE OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY, SOLAN','HP UNIVERSITY',2014,'A',69,'NULL','','',0,'',0,'B.TECH/ ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATION ENGINEERING','2014','Asst.

Indias contribution to space science in general and astronomy and astrophysics specifically has a hoary past with contributions from intellectual geniuses like Aryabhatta, Bhaskara, Varahamihira in the ancient history to modern day legends like Meghnad Saha, Vainu Bappu, V.V.Narlikar, S. Chandrasekhar etc. \r\nSpace science in India has been growing with the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) focusing on moon research and Mars Mission of India and Astrosat - Indias first dedicated astronomy satellite scheduled to launch on board the PSLV in 2014. The making of satellites for communication, mapping and education are all part of Indias space research program. The IT revolution has also played a role in augmenting the progress in space science. Space science deals with the human advances towards exploration of outer space and related technology.\r\nThanks to the sudden surge of economic growth since past decade there has been an acute demand for skilled technical manpower. To participate in the momentous technological growth in the country I successfully completed BE in Electronics &amp; Telecommunications Engineering in 2004 from University of Pune. Being technically focused with a zeal for R&amp;D work and coming from a family of teachers, I had proclivity to pursue teaching profession and have been actively engaged as a faculty member of Vignans Nirula Institute of Technology and Science for Women, Guntur.\r\nIn order to scale higher professional peaks, I am determined to pursue a career in Astrophysics and the like to take advantage of the good science background I have acquired in the recent years. Thanks to my schooling at Sri Sathya Sai Education System I have acquired the much needed self discipline, perseverance, leadership skills and ethics to help me nurture my ambitions. \r\nAstrophysics as a branch of space science, strikes me as one of the most exciting areas of research today. Thanks to new observations, better methods and more powerful simulations, such as those spearheaded by the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics, we can now hope to answer, with reasonable confidence, some of the most profound questions ever raised. Cosmology has emerged forever from the old books of mythology to assert itself as an exact science, an unclouded crystal ball of the universe. I would like to be a part of it.\r\nI now seek admission into the Integrated M Tech - PhD program at the prestigious National Centre for Radio Astrophysics so that I can fulfill my career goals in a reputed R&amp;D institution. Given the opportunity, I assure you that I shall spare no effort to complete the coveted Degree with flying colours.\r\n\r\n\r\n','','1.

But I was unable to qualify for interview.','Theory','I am interested in topics Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and Relativistic Fluid Dynamics (RFD), in the field of Astrophysics. I am looking forward to work in one of these two fields with computational approach, for my doctoral research work in IUCAA. My interest in MHD stems because of the challenging fact that one needs to solve governing equations of fluid dynamics and electromagnetism simultaneously. I will get a chance to explore the physics of fascinating celestial objects such as stars, interstellar medium, intergalactic medium, nebulae, jets etc by studying MHD. The fact that governing equations of RFD are more general than Navier-Stokes equations for simple Newtonian fluids interests me to study RFD.  \r\nI am willing to do my doctoral research work in one of these fields because of my research experience in the area of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), which I can apply and extend to study MHD and RFD. CFD and Computational Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics share some common challenges of computations of fluid phenomena such as turbulence, shock discontinuities, shock-turbulence interaction. T. J. Chung in his book Computational Fluid Dynamics by Cambridge University Press, systematically highlights these challenges in CFD with their extension to Computational Astrophysical (relativistic) Fluid Dynamics. The courses like Electrodynamics and Radiative Processes offered in IUCAA-NCRA graduate school will help me getting acquainted with topics like MHD. Therefore, I can start my research work smoothly after finishing systematic coursework at IUCAA-NCRA, under the guidance of one of the faculty members in IUCAA. \r\nI have done my Masters thesis in the one of most pressing and challenging topic of CFD i.e. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of transonic flows, for which I have numerically solved 2D unsteady compressible Navier-Stokes equations. DNS of such flows is one of the most challenging areas in CFD, particularly due to the presence of shocks and discontinuities in the solution. Our research findings reporting the timeaccurate solutions of transonic flows have now been accepted for publication in the reputed international journal, Computers and Fluids (DOI: 10.1016/j.compfluid.2013.08.007). The major conclusion for our paper is that - unlike conventional approaches, one can accurately compute compressible as well as incompressible flows using the same numerical methods, provided those methods satisfy the dispersion relation of the governing equation.  This conclusion motivated me to search for more general problem related to fluid dynamics. Under the guidance of my thesis supervisor, Prof. T. K. Sengupta, I gained knowledge of High-Accuracy Computing (HAC), dispersion relation preserving high resolution numerical methods (Compact Schemes) and possible sources of errors due to numerics. This knowledge is directly applicable to any field of science and engineering where HAC is required. I want to use and apply my HAC knowledge in topics of Astrophysics such as MHD and RFD and explore these fields in my doctoral research. In view of my motivation, I honestly believe that a doctoral research from IUCAA will provide me opportunity to study my field of interest and help me to make a good research career in the same field.\r\n','I have published 2 international journal and one international conference paper.

The science goals of Astrophysics are breathtaking, here we seek to understand the universe and our place in it. In this we try to investigate the very moment of creation of the universe and are close to learning the full history of stars and galaxies. We are discovering how planetary systems form and how environments hospitable for life develop. And we will search for the signature of life on other worlds, perhaps to learn that we are not alone. The topics of immense interest include attempts to determine: the properties of dark matter, dark energy, and black holes.\r\nIn astrophysics Observational Astrophysics is of my prime concern. Since my childhood I always wanted to study this subject. It will give me a chance to observe celestial objects by using telescopes and other astronomical apparatus. The majority of astrophysical observations are made using the electromagnetic spectrum.\r\nI also want to observe and study the internal structure and composition of white dwarf stars, the remnants of a nuclear fusion furnace that once turned hydrogen into helium and energy, a process which still powers stars like the Sun.\r\n I have also read about the WET( Whole Earth Telescope). This instrument has provided a wealth of seismological data on the different varieties of pulsating white dwarf stars.

I wonder whether our universe is alone or is one of the eigenstates of a large set of eigenfunctions of a quantum mechanical system and I believe IUCAA will guide me to a path wherein I can find those answers. I went through many books of astronomy and astrophysics trying to understand it even if it was out of my scope. My inclination towards Astrophysics can be cited from the fact that I was selected for state level seminar on Chandrayaan: Promises and Concerns organised by Birla Industrial and Technological Museum when I was in class IX and I have also attended IUCAAs workshop on cosmology held in Sri Venkateswara college on 4th and 5th September 2014 under the able resource persons Prof.Kandaswamy Subramaniam and Prof.R Srianand from IUCAA and Prof.T.R Seshadri from Delhi University. My goal is to analyse and build new theories in the field of astrophysics with mathematical rigor put to best use.

The Planetary Sciences and exploration Program Impact of solar system objects organized by Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) at National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI-CSIR),Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India (2013,  Jan 06 - 12) was my first introduction to the subject of solar system and Planetary bodies. Fortunately, I got the opportunity to be a part of PLANEX group at PRL to begin my career. Before coming at PRL as Project associate I attained hands on experience of some projects related to Applied Physics. During my coursework, I have done a project on Real Time Application Project under Renewable energy sources and designed some kits using solar energy to facilitate few simple basic uses.  In PRL, we have an Astronomy division. I started attending the lecture, seminars and colloquium about the all the topics relevant to galaxies, stars and universe.  Since then I become crazy about the subject, observations etc. The Program is aimed to provide very fundamental understanding of science related to space. Therefore, being a part of this program, I may get a platform to pave my path towards my scientific career. \r\n','I was imparting in the development of a Lander payload MESDA (Moon Electrostatic Potential and Dust Analyser) accepted for being sent on upcoming Indian Space Mission on Moon (Chandrayaan II) which is aimed to probe the  Electrostatic properties of lunar dust and its Levitation.

','Theory, Observations, Computation','Stars are always amazing. When I look up at the night sky, a wave of queries passes through my mind. What the stars are? How they shine and where from they come?\r\n      From ancient time, human minds have been searching for the ultimate answer of the mysterious question mark on the stars. As astrophysics is the tool for the study of the structural and evolutionary behaviours  of the stars, it is interesting and exciting for me to understand what the constituents  of a star are and how can reveal the secrets of various stellar properties.        \r\n   When I look up at the night sky through a telescope, the Moon, Saturn, Venus, Vega, Arcturus etc. motivate me to think deeper. I am inspired to see how we can extract different properties of stars like sunspots and brightness of stars. Involved in some exercise in SDSS Sky Server, given as assignment by one of my Astrophysics teacher, I have become ambitious to use a rich set of astrophysical data to uncover the Universe.\r\n            The most important part of astrophysics is to reveal the mystery of evolution of the Universe and to know the fate of the Universe. Big Bang, Black Hole, Supernova, Galaxies, Neutron stars, Clusters of stars, Dark energy , Dark Matter, Gravitational Wave etc. all are encompassed by this discipline.\r\n        Four hundred years ago Galileo stepped forward through observation. Kepler came with three beautiful laws. From Newtons gravity to Einsteins space-time, almost all the mysteries of the Universe have been uncovered. But I am eager to know what the mysteries are left in the Universe to be revealed and to find some relation between the Universe and life itself.\r\n         Besides the marvels of the sky, astrophysics is also exciting in the sense that it helps development of fundamental theories. This is why the subject is of immense importance.\r\n\r\n','I went to CTP, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi on 2012 for a two month summer research fellowship programme organized by Indian Academy Of Sciences where I worked with Prof. Mohammad Sami on Freidmann Model.

I completed my early education (up to 10th std.) in rural areas where there was only one school in an around the village. During those days it was really hard for me to know what the competitive world is. Though I was inspired by many people, among them my father (an engineer), Dr. Vikram Sarabhai (an Indian space scientist) and Kalpana Chawla (Indian born NASA astronaut) were on the top list. These inspirations really carried me up to this level. Apart from my school studies I was spending some time with my telescope (4 Newtonian telescope) by enjoying the beauty of the moon, the sky, sometimes lunar eclipse. By this way I started my journey towards Astrophysics.\r\nI gained my first research experience in post graduation when I started doing project in Quantum Field Theory. I became acquainted with principles of Quantum Field Theory which has impressed me by its profoundness and beauty. At that time I made a firm decision to specialize in theory. I was fascinated by beautiful and difficult mathematical constructions of QFT, but I also became interested in deep interconnections between QFT and Astrophysics. In order to get to the bottom of these interconnections, I decided to deepen my knowledge of Physics and Mathematical theories.\r\nAlong with my project I also attended many seminars and workshops on Astronomy and Astrophysics, Quantum mechanics, String theory, LQG and a conference on Application of Mathematics, which helped me, learn more about current hot topics and trends in the field of Astrophysics.\r\nAs I said in above sentences my future work will be applying the applications of QFT to Astrophysics and I am sure that I will get a good result.\r\nIn summary, I feel that my course work in Physics have prepared me for my further studies with a wide range of interests but definite goals. My motivation to succeed is reflected in my dedication to research. I feel that these attributes, combined with a profound interest, will ensure me to success as research scholar. I am sure that your PhD program will finally lead me to my dream.\r\nI am confident that I will remain the hardworking and determined person that I am, in my further studies too and work in Physics not only for the sake of personal enjoyment but also produce applicable results and to contribute for the immense growth of our country. \r\n ','I gained my first research experience when I started doing project in Quantum Field Theory. Actually this was my masters thesis, titled with Propagators in Field theory. Here I have worked in finding propagator for free particle for Simple harmonic oscillator and also to free field. Then I learnt how to quantize the scalar field using Fourier decomposition method and finally derived the first physical result in quantum field theory.\r\nAt present I am working as a Project Assistant at Center for High Energy Physics (CHEP), Indian Institute Of Science (IISc) Bangalore, India.

Curiosity of man to explore the secrets behind this heavenly phenomenon is as ancient as himself. And now I stand as such one.\r\nAstronomy, one of the branches of observational physics, is one of the most appropriate option for a physics student, because it opens me chances to find solutions to the problems that I ever wonder, how the universe originated, how big it is, is there other habitable planets, what is inside the stars, galaxies and planets ; is our universe will end and how we know all these things. It makes me curious to learn a whole lot about this universe as well as about how much we have to discover more. That is, it provides the platform for the exploration, observation and analysis of the large scale universe around us.\r\nThe sky at night and light had captured my mind from childhood.  Phenomenon like the sun rise, sun set, twinkling of stars, constellations, solar and lunar eclipses etc took part in growing my interest towards astronomy. The main problem it makes me confused is the origin of the universe. The eagerness to know the various explanations behind the big bang theory adds impulse to my interest. Astronomical studies may give chance to explore the highly elusive areas like the properties of dark matter, dark energy and black holes. Formation and evolution of solar system and galaxies are some areas that make me astonished. Is every star is like the sun, if not what makes the difference are some questions that I want to get satisfactory answers. The ambiguities about the existence of black holes make me anxious to know more about it.\r\nMost importantly the glorious victory over space research of my country encourages me to go ahead with my dream. India stands as a different voice in space research among the world. From Aryabhatta up to our first mars mission Mangalyan India writes its history of success with golden letters again and again. All these glorious achievements of India have an important role in developing my interest towards astronomy.\r\nMore over there is a fact that within few billion years the sun will run out of its hydrogen in its core and expand into a red gaint and to a white dwarf. It will be a great disaster to our earth and to the whole life. But hopes are remaining that man with exploring mind may be able to find a new home to the lives. As a highly motivated student towards astronomy I want to be the part of the search and want to take my on efforts in the journey to achieve it.\r\nI have always been curious about this subject and I am sure that this course will give me a broad understanding of all that I need to know more about the universe and may it will satisfy the curiosity of my mind to some extent.\r\n','As a part of the UG program  carried out a project to study the characteristics of  a Solarcell.','N/A','N/A','No','Selected','No','No','2014-09-09 12:04:39'),(317,'RAKESH R','1992-08-05','Male','INDIAN','aerakesh@gmail.com','Lourdes Matha College of Science and Technology, \r\nLourdes Hills, Kuttichal\r\nThiruvananthapuram, Kerala','695574','THIRUVANANTHAPURAM','Kerala','+919400992674','Lourdes Matha College of Science and Technology, \r\nLourdes Hills, Kuttichal\r\nThiruvananthapuram, Kerala','695574','THIRUVANANTHAPURAM','Kerala','OBC','Xth Std','St.Philips S S K Nellikad','Kerala State Board',2008,'A+',90,'XIIth Std','Fr.Philips H S S Nellikad','Kerala State Board',2010,'B+',77,'B.Tech.','Lourdes Matha College of Science and Technology','Kerala University',2014,'B+',76,'NULL','','',0,'',0,'B.Tech ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERING','2014','G P ROHINI \r\nM.Tech\r\nAssociate Professor','THOMAS BABY\r\nM.Tech\r\nAssociate Professor','I completed my B.Tech in the year 2014 and (before and) since then I am searching for an opportunity to expand my studies in Physics.','No',NULL,'Theory, Observations, Computation','I want to dedicate my life to one thing which I am only interested in.','','','','No','Rejected','No','No','2014-09-09 12:32:41'),(318,'om parkash','1985-08-09','Male','Indian','pickujaggi@gmail.com','om parkash s/o sh partap singh \r\nv.p.o. baranda\r\nteh nurpur\r\ndist kangra\r\nh.p.176201','176201','Pathankot','Himachal Pradesh','01893238460','om parkash s/o sh partap singh \r\nv.p.o. baranda\r\nteh nurpur\r\ndist kangra\r\nh.p.176201','176201','Pathankot','Himachal Pradesh','General','Xth Std','Govt.High School Baranda','H.P.B.S.E.Dharamshala',2002,'',67,'XIIth Std','G.S.S.School Gangath','H.P.B.S.E.Dharamshala',2005,'',57,'B.Sc.','Govt.degree col dehri','H.P.U.Shimla',2010,'',50,'M.Sc.','Arni University kathgarh ((H.P.)','Arni university ',2014,'',67,'M.Sc.(physics)','2014','Mr.Vishal kapil (H.O.D.Physics)','Mr.Vikram kumar(lab.supervisor)','During degree i studied more and more about physics.In this time more emphasis was given on practical work.Many concept which were in my mind now slowly undrstand by me.In last year of my degree i visited to G.N.D.U.Amritsar (Pb) that was very interesting trip of my life.','No',NULL,'Theory','The thing which makes me interested in astrophysics is that the movement of all the planet arround the sun without application of any force.For understanding this concept i visited many website which provide me their different views.But in my mind still some confussion is present like which thing provide force to planet which makes them able to revolve around the sun.If answer is Gravitational force then again one question is there and that is if gravitational force provide them force to revolve around the sun then which thing make sun and other planet.For its answer one theory which i read that says very early of this universe the gases due to gravitational force come close to each other and clump s and make huge piece of gas which was named sun and other small clumps become other planet.Such interesting thing which push me toward knowing more and more thing about planet.','I did my research work on nano particles.It was really interested.In my project work i studied about nano particles and their strength.It was very interesting that the strength of a material increases as the size of the particles of material reduce to nano level.During my project work i also find the shape of the nanocrystal by using XRD method.Dopping was also done for improving the strength of given material.','N.A.','N.A.','No','Rejected','No','No','2014-09-09 12:33:31'),(319,'arjun ashok','1994-06-13','Male','INDIAN','arjun.ashok256@gmail.com','S/O ASHOK KUMAR P\r\n\"kannans kittus \" (H)\r\nvazhunnorady\r\nuppilikkai (p.o)\r\nnileshwar(via)\r\nkasaragod(dist)\r\nkerala','671314','Kanhangad','Kerala','9746621977','st. pius X college rajapuram\r\nrajapuram(p.o)\r\nanandashram(via)\r\nkasaragod(dist)\r\nkerala','671532','kanhangad','Kerala','OBC','Xth Std','chinmaya vidyalaya,nileshwar','cbse',2010,'',77,'XIIth Std','chinmaya vidyalaya,kannur','cbse',2012,'',64,'B.Sc.','st pius X college , rajapuram','kannur university',2015,'',70,'NULL','N/A','N/A',0,'',0,'BSC PHYSICS','2015','  THOMAS MATHEW\r\nASST.PROFESSOR DEPT.

Being a science graduate ,rather a B.Tech graduate I feel that my inclination towards astronomy is due to my scientific bent of mind and I firmly believe that I would be able to pursue the course with a lot of enthusiasm because that is where my interest lies.','I have carried out a major project on Smart Traffic Light Controller in B.Tech VIII semester. The aim of the project was to implement a density based traffic controller which is reliable and simple considering the current situation of India and its economic base. To solve the problem a model was designed which could be implemented in real time and is relevant for Indian Traffic control system.A dynamic time based system was proposed where the green signal time of traffic lights is assigned based on the present conditions of traffic .A triggering circuit along with the microcontroller guides the functioning of the whole process thus saving time and making the whole process more efficient.

By the way it is quite obvious, because our universe is full of mysteries and surprises. It has been a subject of physics to solve these mysteries called astrophysics. Astrony is one of the most discussed  subject and still discussing, has provided  very broad knowledge about galaxies  and stars. Now the time it has become vey convenient  to get knowledge  about movement and properties of stars and galaxies. \r\n            Astrophysics is the branch of astronomy that deals with the physics of universe including physical properties  of calastial objects  as well their interaction and behavior.\r\n           Because astrophysics is very broad subject, it requires broad  knowledge about many other subject like mechanics, elecctromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics , relativity,nuclear physics and atomic and molecular physics.\r\n         As being the student of science of and being an Indian it is the thing for me to be proud that India has the glorious past in astrophysics and astronomy.The evidences have shown  that Indian astrophysics has developed after 1500 BCE from Vedas. There have been many great astrophysisists like Aryabhatta, Bhaskara, Bhrahmagupta, Lalla and many others who wrote numerous books an astrophysics which are still useful in modern astrophysics.\r\n           As a student I am always worring about my future, but after joining astrophysics I will not have to worry about it because there are lot institutions in India like IUCAA, IIA, ARISE, and  as well as abroad which provides excellent education and also carrier opportunities.\r\n        Thus, point of view of knowledge, astrophysics require knowledge of almost every subject of physics. As I am concerned with theoretical astrophysics, it would make me to have knowledge of all subjects. Further considering past and present about astrophysics I think I can have my best future in theoretical  astrophysics. These are all the reasons why choose to study theoretical astrophysics.','No.','Yes, I have got the second rank in the quiz competition which was about physics, held at the Saurashtra university rajkot by the department of physics.','No','No','Selected','No','No','2014-09-09 14:15:41'),(326,'SNEHA GUPTA','1992-11-24','Female','INDIAN','kittygupta16@gmail.com','GURUDWARA PARA MAIN ROAD BAGBAHARA DIST MAHASAMUND (C.G) ','493449',' MAHASAMUND','Chhattisgarh','07752 414865','GURUDWARA PARA MAIN ROAD BAGBAHARA DIST MAHASAMUND (C.G) ','493449',' MAHASAMUND','Chhattisgarh','General','Xth Std','ISWARI BAL VIDYA MANDIR ','CGBSE ',2006,'1',73,'XIIth Std','SARSVATI SHISHU VIDYA MANDIR ','CGBSE',2009,'1',71,'B.Sc.','GGU ','GGU',2012,'1',72,'M.Sc.','GGU','GGU',0,'',0,'MSC (ELECTRONICS)','2014','ASHISH SHRIVASTAVA  (LABORATORY SUPERVISORS)','P.K BAJPAI (PROFESSOR)','NO','No',NULL,'Theory, Observations, Computation','I WANT TO GO TO NAASA ','NO ','NO ','NO ','No','Rejected','No','No','2014-09-09 14:50:45'),(327,'PALLAVI DIXIT','1993-08-10','Female','INDIAN','pallavidixit1008@gmail.com','INDIRA GANDHI GIRLS HOSTEL,SATI DEGREE COLLEGE','464001','Vidisha','Madhya Pradesh','07682244269','CIVIL LINE ROAD ,SATI DEGREE COLLEGE','464001','Vidisha','Madhya Pradesh','General','Xth Std','KENDRIY VIDYALAYA SCHOOL,SEONI','CBSE',2009,'8.96',89,'XIIth Std','DPS,BHILAI','CBSE',2011,'8.2',82,'B.E.','SAMRAT ASHOK TECHNOLOGICAL INSTITUTE','RGPV UNIVERSITY',2015,'8.23',82,'NULL','N/A','',0,'',0,'B.E,ELECTRONICS AND INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERING','2015','MANISH YADAV,TEACHER','KG KIRAR,MENTOR','','No',NULL,'Theory, Observations, Computation','BECAUSE MY MATHS AND PHYSICS ARE GOOD','','','','Yes','Selected','No','No','2014-09-09 15:35:29'),(328,'ANITHA T V','1994-08-14','Female','INDIAN','anithatv14@gmail.com','THEKKETHIL HOUSE\r\nTHEKKETHARA \r\nPAZHAYANNUR P O\r\nTHRISSUR DIST\r\nPIN 680587','680587','Thrissur','Kerala','04884 224490','N S S COLLEGE \r\nPALAPPURAM P O\r\nOTTAPALAM\r\nPALAKKAD DIST\r\nPIN 679103','679103','PALAKKAD','Kerala','OBC','Xth Std','GOVT H S S PAZHAYANNUR','KERALA STATE BOARD',2009,'A+',95,'XIIth Std','GOVT H S S PAZHAYANNUR','KERALA HSE BOARD',2011,'A',88,'B.Sc.','N S S COLLEGE OTTAPALAM','UNIVERSITY OF CALICUT',2014,'A+',97,'NULL','N/A','N/A',0,'NA',0,'BSC PHYSICS','2014','P SASIDHARAN\r\nASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AND HOD\r\nDEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS\r\nN S S COLLEGE OTTAPALAM','K NAYANA\r\nASSISTANT PROFESSOR\r\nDEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS \r\nN S S COLLEGE OTTAPALAM','NA','No',NULL,'Theory, Observations, Computation','As all of us know,Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences which deals with the study of celestial objects such as stars,planets,galaxies etc,the physics and chemistry and the evolution of such objects and the phenomena that originate outside the atmosphere of earth. \r\n          From my little knowledge,i noticed that astronomy is one of the few sciences where amateurs can still play an active role,especially in the discovery and observation of transient phenomena.That promoted my interest towards this field.Amateur astronomy is usually associated with viewing the night sky when most celestial objects and events that are visible using nothing more than their eyes.\r\n          Sky watching is one of my favorite hobby from childhood.

That boosted my wish to research the details associated with ending the world bye throwing earth in to black hole.\r\n          As i learned some basics about astronomy from my school time and from undergraduate courses ,one striking point i noticed that there is always a bold heading in all text books \"WHAT IS THE UNIVERSE MADE OF\" .Even i tried to answer this question with my limited knowledge ,there is still a dissatisfaction for my answer that hooked me to think about research in astronomy. \r\n          Even in my casual reading of newspaper,i always careful to read all news that relates with  our celestial objects.

My education or the process of learning had been started in two parallel streams. One of them was the \"Quran\" studies in its own perspective where I was amazed on its verses in which \"The Creator\" narrates his creation of universe- the earthly and the heavenly bodies. And the other one was my schooling education during which I met the \"alphabets\" of Astronomy. The very first thing which anticipated my special interest in Astrophysics was the \"calendars\" and the thoughts on it. I had chosen Physics as my field of study in my undergraduate level program during which I familiarized more with the methodology and perspectives of Physics.I believed and I do believe that Physics is the \"language\" in which the nature has written its \"autobiography\" . I realize it is my duty as an individual belongs to the nature, to develop my skills in the \"language\" and to read the \"autobiography\" and it is the best way to understand the phenomena that occur in the nature. And I feel Astrophysics as the chapter deals with the very personal matters in the autobiography. In Astrophysics my area of interest is Cosmogony-the origin of universe which is still a hidden secret in the heart of the nature. Initially I thought that it was very hard to get into Astrophysics as it is regarding our magical and dreamy concepts of universe and heavenly objects and also there were not many astrophysicists around me. Later I came to know that the works and achievements in Astronomy and Astrophysics are getting promoted, progressed and improved especially in India. To mention a few the works and research papers in the institutes like IUCAA and IAA and in Indian Astronomical Observatory which has the fourth largest telescope in the world. Also India bagged three medals in International Olympiad in Astronomy and Astrophysics 2010 in China and these hard works enhanced my interest. Specifically I would like to do my work on dark matter-the gravitational glue to hold the galaxies together that much consists of hypothetical WIMP(Weakly Interacting Massive Particles)- and theoretical modelling of the origin and the evolution of universe. Being inspired by the recent works like the discovery of dark matter particle by a research group from BHU and the latest LUX(Large Underground Xenon Dark matter experiments),I would like to take it to the next step to study the distribution and influence of dark matter in galaxies. I do expect that i can get into this discipline as my field of study and I hope to contribute myself to the \"ink\" to complete the still unwritten portions of \"Universal Autobiography\".','During my undergraduate level program in Physics I had done an experiment to study the salt concentration in different regions of Chaliyar- a river in Calicut District of Kerala. It was done by using the method of Liquid Prism-Spectrometer arrangement. The project was mainly focused on variation of refractive index with concentration of solutions and thus to find the salt concentration in the river water.

I did a group reading project on \"Evolution of Universe for different Cosmological Models\" under the guidance and supervision of Prof. Tarun Souradeep and presented a poster as the result. We had an opportunity to pay a visit to observatories like GMRT and Two Meter Telescope of IUCAA at Girawali. It was a prominent time where my passion towards Astrophysics got intensified.','Theory, Observations, Computation','I am a fervent admirer of nature since my childhood. As the heavenly bodies beckon many minds, so it did to me. This admiration begets quest in me. My inquisitive nature urged me to find answers to all the questions. Consequently, I started reading and questioning my teachers. The answer i found and heard was amazing and unimaginable. The terms \"Astro-, Space\" often connotes a sense of fascination to me. The all-pervasive gravitational field, axiomatic facts on Black Holes and inflation made me to be glued with this discipline of Astrophysics. Another prime source of inspiration was biographies and autobiographies of eminent people. Especially, the pioneers of Physics and Astrophysics. Einstein, Newton and Hawking to mention a few. Many deep insights of understanding of Universe to mankind have been contributed by such scientists.They were the people with radically different notions. Their lives left an indelible impression on me and inspired me to become an Astrophysicist. Graduation in Physics was a strategic fulcrum of my career.  Physics being the vivid tool of Astronomy and Astrophysics, I found that understanding the fundamentals in Physics is a sine qua non to study Astrophysics. \r\nIncredible discoveries including Acceleration of Universe with experimental evidence, Standard Models to study the evolution of Universe( recently, Lambda Cold Dark Matter Model) have been a great sign of encouragement to choose this field. More recently, a significant breakthrough in Astrophysics- finding of Cosmic Microwave Background, \"a relic radiation\" which is  ubiquitous throughout the universe and experiments based on Gravitational Waves enraptured my thoughts and I am strongly motivated to contribute my part in this discipline. All possible contingency plans of new observatories in India is another conspicuous positive intimation to pursue research in Astrophysics. ','I have done a project on \"Automated Street Light Controller\" in my UG under the course on Basics of research in Physics. Its one of the applications of that use Photovoltaic technology in the street lighting. Efficiency and power loss of solar street lighting system has been studied. The main focus was conservation of electrical energy and the efficient use of solar energy for street lights.\r\nI have also done a group project on Helmet protecting System for a science expo. The system makes it mandatory for the rider to wear helmet before starting the vehicle. Wireless technology and pressure sensor were used. The model aimed to assure a safe ride and to achieve strict following of traffic rules.\r\nI have done a reading project on \"Evolution of Universe for different Cosmological Models\" as apart of SSP at IUCAA and calculated the age of the Universe using the data of COBE satellite.','I am a recipient of gold medal for my outstanding performance during my Under Graduation.\r\nI received Merit scholarship for two years during Under Graduation for being the topper in my department in College and another Merit Scholarship for being the university (Bharathidasan Universiy) rank holder(11).\r\nI have secured first position in State level Science Quiz contest (Jantar Mantar) conducted by Tamilnadu Science Forum in the year 2008.\r\nI have secured secod position in State Level India Quiz contest and received a cash award from Dr. Mayilsamy Annadurai, Director of Chandrayaan who presided over the felicitation program.\r\nThe paper I presented on \"Bio-Char, A super Climate Healer\" received best paper presentation award in 18th National Children Science Congress.

The earth revolving its own axis, rotating around the sun, and the planets rotating around the earth are all mysterious. Astronomy  is not a new word to the world it is the science that studies everything outside if the earths atmosphere such as planets, stars, asteroids, galaxies and the properties and the relationships of those celestial bodies. Astronomy can be related to our culture and religion. Probably one of the most tangible and practical benefits of astronomy was on agriculture. Archeoastronomy is the practical use of astronomy as it applies to early cultures. It is of interest to astronomers and archeologists because it encompasses the study of astronomical principles employed in ancient works of architecture as well as the practice of astronomy and methods of observations among ancient peoples. The devices like Stonehenge were used in England for observing celestial bodies. Even though many theories were proposed observing these objects, practical proofs was given only after Galelio inventing telescope.\r\nIndias, as can be expected from an ancient culture, has a long astronomical tradition. In any study of astronomy it is impossible to ignore the works of great Indian astronomers. As with other traditions, the original application of astronomy was religious. Indian astronomy flowered with Aryabhatta in the 5th -6th century. He opened a new gate way of astronomical knowledge at that time. Other astronomers of the classical era is further elaborated on Aryabhattas work include Brahmagupta and Varamihira. With developing India astronomy also begun its growth. To make the studies about the planets more easier and clear, astronomical centers were started in India. The Vedic literature and Upanishads which contain the Indian tradition and culture gives the information about the stars, planets and other heavenly bodies. The  Adarva Veda which is very ancient explains about 27 stars and their positions. In ancient times when there were no proper calendars, people had no way of determining when to sow or harvest except by the stars. The ancient people knew that when the constellation Orion started to be fully visible, winter was coming soon. They would also predict the summer or spring by looking at the summer triangle in the sky. \r\nIndian culture and history thus has a great dependence on astronomy and astrophysics. As an Indian I would like to become a part of the observational astronomy team to make the Indian contribution in this field a great success in front of the world. I am interested to know the physics behind the celestial bodies, its evolution and would like to give its theoretical explanations to the world.\r\n\r\n','I did a project work on the topic  \"POLYANILINE COATED NATURAL FIBRES-CHEMICAL AND STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION\".

I generally used to watch documentary videos related to Astrophysics. Basically I like videos related to Blackholes, Dark Matter &amp; Dark Energy, Missions like Mars Rover(Curiosity), Kepler Mission etc. Its funny but I would like to say that I am interested in Aliens. Several Missions are going on for finding the evidence of existence of Aliens. If I will get a chance to work in this field I will happily accept it.\r\n\r\nThese are all about Documentary Videos. Except this as I have undertaken M.Sc. in Astrophysics in Pondicherry University. We have papers like Fundamentals of Astronomy, Astronomocal Techniques, Stellar Physics, Radiative Process and Fluid &amp; Plasma. Its very interesting because here we are applying the general physics knowledge to study these papers. So its like application of physics in describing astronomial phenomena.While studying Astrophysics the most important and interesting part is imagining and visualizing the processes.The most interesting part of mine is Stellar Evolution from the birth of Star from interstellar gas and dust to the end as a White Dwarf/Neutron Star/Black hole. Till now I know something about White Dwarf and Neutron Star but interesting is Black hole. I would like to do one project on Black holes may be my final year project. Still now I am not fully clear in physics but while studying Astrophysics I look into Electrodynamics, Statistical, Classical, Quantum Mechanics parallaly side by side. So I am getting interest in Astrophysics. \r\n\r\nExcept this course works sometimes I read books of Stefan Hawking like A brief history of Time, The First Three Minutes by Steven Weinberg whenever I get time.\r\n\r\nThe thing is that we are studying theoritically all these but we also need some observation so projects in any research institude is very much needed. I got more interest in this field after my last summer project in IIA. I was doing spectroscopy there. Those data were Optical so now I would like to go for some Radio data analysis.\r\n\r\nThe above were some of my interest about Theoritical and Observational. But actually my 1st interest is Instrumentation like working on telescopes basically space based telescopes. I have never got any chance to do such type of work. I had one wish to go for instrumentation of satellites, Rocket and space flight design, but unfortunately I do not have B.Tech. degree so could not go for M.Tech. in Aerodynamics. Its okay Astronomical Instrumentation is also play important role in getting high resolution data by developing the technology used in telescopes. So I will be happy if I get chance to work in astronomical Instrumentation. \r\n\r\nThese all are my interests in Astrophysics and I am always ready to work in this field.

We had used calibration of Carrera et al. (2013) for determining the metallicity of our program stars and compared our results from high resolution spectroscopy metallicity values. A large number of CH stars are faint objects. It is not possible to obtain high resolution spectra for the fainter objects with the existing facilities in India.  Using low resolution spectra metallicity of these stars can be derived with the obtained accuracy of -0.57 to +0.63 dex. The most metal-poor objects found by this method will make important targets for follow-up chemical composition studies based on high resolution spectroscopy.','INSPIRE Scholarship (2010-2015)\r\nReg.

In the same year, I had done my Summer Project at IUCAA under the guidance of Prof. Dipankar Bhattacharya. I had also attended the Radio Astronomy Winter School at NCRA the same year.','Theory, Observations, Computation','Astronomy is one of the oldest subjects in Science which has been carried out by many people across the world. The subject was mainly subjected to observations and was open to everyone, not just to the people of Science. After the development of Modern Physics, Astrophysics also developed as a subject to understand the Physics involved in the study of the celestial objects and the Universe. I am very curious person by nature and there is nothing more mysterious and exciting than the hidden secrets of the Universe which has intrigued the Human faction for so long. That is what binds me, attracts me towards Astrophysics and Astronomy. As any other kid, I was also startled by the beauty of the night sky which amazed me in many ways and drove me today to take up this subject as my career as I am never tired of watching the sky and admiring the beauty of Nature. Being a student of Physics, I also came to know about the various laws and principles that define the physical world and when I realized the connection between the physical laws and the \"heaven\" I was more than impressed. I carried out my own research in the field of Astronomy and Astrophysics by reading different books and articles on the subject by eminent scientists across the world. That inspired me and motivated me to go further. While in the second year of my B.Sc, I got selected in the Summer Research Fellowship of IASc, Bangalore and fortunately I got a chance to work one of the leading institutes in this field, IUCAA. I was at IUCAA for about two months and that proved to be the best time of my life. Not only I was doing what I love, but also the interaction with different research scholars, professors really gave me so much inspiration and motivation. I was more than satisfied. Completing my project, I decided I would take up Astrophysics as my career and with the blessing of God and my parents, I got admission at the Dept. Of Astrophysics, Pondicherry University for my M.Sc. I was really excited to finally have entered into the field of Astrophysics and thus I carried on my journey with it. Apart from the course work, I joined the Astronomy Club of Pondicherry University which gave me hands-on experience in the field of Astronomy. With the 8-inch Newtonian Telescope, we use to observations night over nights. I was finally doing what I love. With theoretical understandings, I also had exposure to the practical astronomy with the club which gave me more insight into this field and further inspired to follow the path which I had chosen. Even this year, doing a summer project at IIA gave me more exposure to the research life in Astrophysics and Astronomy and proved me correct to have chosen this field. And hence, here I am applying for the INAT to get a chance to study in IUCAA.  ','1. IASc Summer Research Fellowship Programme 2012- I did a 8-weeks long project at IUCAA under the guidance of Prof. Dipankar Bhattacharya. I worked on \"Estimation of Magnetic Field strength of Low Mass X-ray Binaries\" which dealt with data reduction and analysis using the software HEASOFT.\r\n2. I attended the Radio Astronomy Winter School-2012 at NCRA,Pune where I got to learn about Fundamentals of Radio Astronomy and hands-on experience through some experiments. Finally I presented a poster along with my Group Mates on \"Square Kilometer Array and Era of Reionization\".\r\n3. I attended the Summer School on Astronomy and Astrophyiscs at Kodaikanl Observatory, IIA. After that I did a 6 weeks Summer Project at IIA, Bangalore under the guidance of Dr. Firoza Sutaria.

The mysteries beyond are much interesting and inspiring!\r\n\r\nThe night sky sowed the seed of curiosity in my little mind when I was a kid. It grew up through \"how\"s and \"why\"s with me. \"What are stars..?\" \"Why we are not falling down from spherical earth..?\" \"How it is possible to see earth in moons sky..?\" and so on..! When I understood the physical laws behind them, those doubts were cleared but new ones began to born in their places.\r\n\r\nWhen I studied about lenses in 8th standard, I made my first telescope. Though it was not optically perfect, I became 100 times more inspired when looked through it! \r\n\r\nAfter 12th standard, I searched for B.Sc Astronomy course. Then only I realized that, I can specialize in A&amp;A only at postgraduate level. I came to know that B.Sc physics or B.Tech in electrical or electronics is apt at graduation level. I chose to do B.Tech in Electrical&amp;Electronics Engineering, which was a safer option.\r\n\r\nDuring my engineering days, the passion towards astronomy and cosmology increased rapidly.. The opportunities that I got from Trivandrum helped me to enrich my passion. The Priyadarsini Planetarium Trivandrum, Amateur Astronomers Organization (AASTRO) Kerala, State central library and British library Kerala, VSSC and TERLS Tumba played significant roles in that empowerment.. I curiously watched rocket launched from Thumba during space week. The seminars arranged at planetarium, the monthly lectures and sky watching camps organized by AASTRO were really useful.\r\n\r\nAfter engineering, I attempting nation-wide entrance exams -including INAT- to get admission for PG/Doctoral programmes in Astronomy.\r\nIn between, I completed an internship at Indian Institute of Astrophysics during 2014 January-May, which was the most beautiful learning experience I ever had in my life so far! I received the first stipend in my life from there. And spent the same for buying a small telescope - a 4 inch reflector!! It was one of my small dreams, to buy a telescope with the first salary.\r\n\r\nNow I am not able to satisfy with any other career than in Astronomy&amp;Astrophysics. The branch of science which makes use of our curiosity and creativity the most is astronomy. The development of astronomy is the development of human race itself. The CCD in your mobile camera, the internet which we cannot live without nowadays are only some of the bi products of our efforts to solve the mysteries of our cosmos. Astronomy reminds us our size and influence in this universe. Our \"big\" Earth itself is infinitesimally small in the scale of this vast universe. All our wars, weapons, worries, egos, religions, beliefs, greed and deeds are contained within it...\r\n\r\nIn the journey to my dreams, I know I have miles to go..

I calculated the maximum height that a mountain on the surface of a white dwarf or neutron star can have. And also calculated the gravitational wave amplitude that will be emitted from surface asymmetries of such magnitude.','Theory, Observations, Computation','I have been interested in astronomy since I was a school student. Back then it was more of a fascination than interest for any real science. But this fascination later developed into an urge to know the science behind what is happening out there up above the sky. This interest made me to pursue BSc in physics. While an undergraduate student I got a chance to interact with many astrophysicists. With their help, I learned more about astrophysics and got seriously interested in this field. Hence, it is no more that childhood fascination for astrophysics but an willingness to address the various unanswered questions. Moreover the few projects that I have done and also from my interaction with astronomers and astrophysicists I have realized that the picture of astronomy that I had in my mind in school is completely different from what real world astronomy is. But this does not decrease my interest in this field, rather the limitations and huge challenges in this field makes me even more interested in the same. In this field the unknown is more than what is known and not all attempt to answer the unanswered question does lead to the correct answer. However it is worth to give a try, as astrophysics basically deals with the most basic concepts of physics applied to far away objects under the assumption that laws of physics are invariant. So astronomical objects really provides with a natural laboratory to test the fundamental theories of physics. It has a great contribution to the development of theoretical physics. And also doing astronomy requires knowledge of all branches of physics. My interest in astrophysics is also supported by the range of question an astronomer or astrophysicists tries to answer and also the types of objects, each interesting in its own way, that an astrophysicists deal with. Other than this, astrophysics is currently one of the most funded subject all over the world including India. Along with funding for improvement of the existing telescopes, various major projects are being carried out all over the world for construction of new ones. So these provides a lot of opportunity in future. Moreover since ground based observatories are mostly located on high mountains or in deserts or in other isolated places where human interference is much less, being an astronomer really provides a chance of visiting such exotic places.','As a VSRP student at NCRA in the summer of 2014, I did my project on  compct objects.

My B.Tech project on Anti-Gravity Propulsion led me to the mysteries of Gravity and its action on each and every body of this Universe, and the strange fact that we cannot escape from the gravity field. From this I got Interested in Physics and attended Summer school on Quantum Mechanics in IMSc. From there, I learned much about the behavior of elementary particles in those quantum world.

I have carried out my project on various Anti-Gravity techniques which were proposed in 20th century and their conspiracy theories. I studied those conspiracy theories and have formulated a method of producing Anti-gravity by means of vibration of a prudently engineered cavity structure. This cavity structure is built by six rectangular and triangular plates which when vibrated by external means produces a sound wave of certain intensity which will lift the cavity. If the calculated intensity produces the necessary force to lift a single cavity, then the single cavity is integrated to many cavities so that it acts a single system that produces lift force. In this project I calculated the response of the cavity structure at different frequencies.

This curiosity lead me another step which is to know about environment around us and as i grew up this curiosity extended further. i always excited when any programme or documentary about astronomy came on dd national. Not only this but i also urged my father to take tv channel connection for watching programmes on Discovery channel. Wherever i found information about universe, planet, comets, nebula, gamma ray bursts, i used leave my work and suddenly my priority would become to approach that information source whatever it may be like news paper, Russel ashs Whitaker, documentary. When i watched documentary film e = mc squared this curiosity surged on higher level. Then i decided to know about theory of relativities that is 1.General theory of relativity, 2. Special theory of relativity. For that i searched on internet about those theories and after that i never looked back. In that period, i used to have dream about moon, spaceship and stuff like that. I also read book brief history of time of Stephen Hawking which i assumed was most sophisticated book i read so far. I was not able to understand most of the theories but my curiosity never come down. Then i had big interest about Stephen Hawking. For that i watched documentary film Hawking which gave me same result.Then there was some article on newspaper about good space movies and one of them was contact. I randomly found out the link of this movie and watched online. I watched this movie about space so much that i watched it twice  back to back and i also cried for the same by knowing how amazing that concept was. These are some of the reasons which interested me about astronomy. This interest haunted me so much that i do not have much movies but a lot documentaries of astronomy that is space, black hole. I am very interesting in knowing about black holes, time travel, and wormholes. I know some of the concepts and want to know more that is what makes me to take interest in astronomy. And thus nothing but the curiosity is the one thing which makes me to show interest toward astronomy. I never leaves single thing left out about astronomy and what to know more and more.  ','I worked on research project about Estimation of spectrum sensing based Direction of Arrival. This project is about utilizing spectrum holes. These holes are due to waste of spectrum if it is not used by primary users. Primary users are the users having licence of spectrum. But when they do not want to use that spectrum on particular angle then secondary user can use that angle of that spectrum. For that i did research on direction of arrival techniques which is to know about angle from which primary user signal is coming and if primary user is not coming from that direction secondary user can use that angle of that spectrum. For that smart antennas along with digital signal processing is used to steer array vector that is to steer signal from one direction to another.  ','','I gave GATE examination and able to score 25.

This makes any thought of Astronomy a day dream. I may have caught a glimpse of Venus, Mars, Jupiter and the usual bright suspects in the 17 years I lived there. After choosing Physics as career, my proper education in Astrophysics started when I chose Astrophysics as a special subject in my second year of Bachelors. Unfortunately we didnt have Astronomy and Astrophysics as a major course in Masters, but then a winter school was a big turning point in my life. I attended the Winter School on Astro Particle Physics (WAPP) at the Cosmic Ray Laboratory, TIFR. Apart from studying about primary and secondary cosmic rays, scintillators, muon detectors, the electronics involved and data analysis I also assembled a scintillator. The opportunity which laid pathway for my current research experience is the 13th PLANEX workshop organized by PLANEX division, Physical Research Laboratory. This one week workshop at National Geophysical Research institute gave vivid knowledge about Impact craters on solar system objects and I also had a field trip to Lonar crater which was the highlight. I gave a seminar in the workshop titled The God Particle and did a small project titled Megascopic and Microscopic characterization of impactities and related rocks. Being selected in the interview, I joined PRL on 22nd July 2013. I have been working under Dr. Santosh V Vadawale and developed a model to calibrate the X-ray Fluorescent (XRF) part of the payload Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer. Though the work is a theoretical model the topics which are being worked here really started fascinating me. We have been sending missions to study right from Mercury to recent Pluto (New Horizon). There are data sets from the instruments on board, telescopes which fly like the Hubble space telescope and the other ground based telescopes, flybys etc aimed for all celestial bodies are sufficient to be analyzed for years and years. Kepler still discovers earth like exo planets and Europa has found to have plate tectonics. These ground breaking discoveries every day unlock the deadly secrets of the place we live in, The Universe. The first work I do in the morning is reading updates from scitechdaily, space.com, sciencedaily and other google updates on space. I have made a 17 minutes video titled Unveiling the Cosmos for the National Science Day, celebrated on 1st March 2013 at PRL which gave me quite a good appreciation and gave a source of encouragement. I am also an active member of the PLANEX Newsletter team and I write News Highlights.My ambition is to take Astronomy or Astrophysics as my career which not only enthral me but also gives a self satisfaction at the end of the day. My long term hobby would be having a telescope at my terrace, writing astronomy books and making astro videos for children.','APXS is a well-proven instrument for quantitative elemental analysis of planetary surfaces through in situ measurements. It involves measurement of characteristic X-rays emitted from the sample due to Alpha Particle Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE), which is dominant for low Z elements and due to X-ray Fluorescence (XRF), which is dominant for high Z elements. The observed XRF line fluxes are converted to corresponding elemental abundances. There is a strong linearity between the intensity and elemental concentrations. A methodology is thus required to utilize the APXS measurements to derive the lunar surface elemental abundances. For this, codes are being written incorporating analytical equations using Fundamental Parameters (mass absorption coefficient, fluorescent yield, jump ratio, transition probability of different elements) for the XRF component. Eventually, the observed energy value will reveal the presence of the particular element (qualitatively) and its intensity will give the concentration of that element (quantitatively).','-  P. V.

From time immemorial, man has been trying to reach the unreach, hear the unheard and to see the unseen. Astronomy is that branch of science that seeks to explain everything that we do observe in the universe,from the comets and planets in our solar system to distant galaxies to the echos of Big-Bang.\r\n\r\nAt very young age, looking at the sky during night to find out different constellations  was like my hobby. Since then, I have got an unusual loving attraction towards the subject of astronomy. I always pondered over the occuring and phenomenons that goes on around the universe. Studying about universe during school days provided me with enough curiosty to know more and more about the universe. Being from a family of physics scholars, its like I have always lived around physics.\r\nTopics like, how galaxies have formed? \r\nHow star formation takes place in our and other galaxies? \r\nHow many solar systems are there in this universe?\r\nWhat the dark energy actually is? \r\nWhat is the size of black hole? \r\nWhat might be the size of the universe? \r\nIf the universe has a definite volume, then what is there beyond it? \r\nEven if the Big-Bang theory tells us how the universe was originated, what was there before the phenomenons of Big-Bang occured? \r\nAnd finally, is there any other planet except our mother Earth that sustains life??\r\nSuch questions have always reverberated in my mind and to find its answers is now my AIM.\r\n\r\nEven if now I am in my third year of b.tech degree, I am still having immense love and curiosity in gathering knowledge and to find out the unrevealed secrets of universe. Keeping regular updates regarding much recent discoveries and the research in the field of astronomy and astrophysics have only added to the curiosity of generating more and more knowledge about the universe.\r\n\r\nAstronomy and astrophysics will give me a strong background in physics and maths. I am really looking forward to get an opportunity to gather that background of physics and do research in the field of astronomy and astrophysics and help my country and and the world in unrevealing the secrets of universe.','No.\r\nSir, I have not yet completed my graduation.

My graduation in Physics made me to learn the salient and major role mathematics play in understanding physics. I realized that mathematics and physics are inextricable.  This motivated me to pursue an intensive study on the subject. The more I studied, the more I found it interesting.\r\n Books, Journals, Articles and talks on various theories that explain Origin of the universe (Big Bang theory), Gravitation (quantum gravity), string theory and Evolution and life cycle of stars were a significant source of inspiration to get enraptured towards astronomy and astrophysics. \r\nI was intrigued by the renowned and distinguished efforts and contributions of the pioneers in Astronomy. Pure theoretical work always draws my attention and interest. So I intend to pursue my research career in theoretical work in Astronomy and Astrophysics. Consequently, I would like to contribute my part in formulating or developing radical theoretical concepts in this discipline and to find answers that reveal many mysteries in nature.','I have done a group project on experimental verification of Stefan fourth power law using vehicle head lamp circuit setup.

Mathematical work was done to connect this empirical relationship and Stefan-Boltzmann law.We measured a series of values of voltages and currents. A small Python script is used for computational work and to draw graphs.  The graph was matching with theoretical assumption that we made.\r\nThis idea could be effectively extended to find the temperature of filaments, wavelength of maximum emission and to compare the efficiency of lamps made by different manufacturers.','I RECEIVED CENTRAL SECTOR SCHOLARSHIP FOR MY OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE IN ACADEMICS DURING MY UNDER GRADUATION.','','No','Selected','No','No','2014-09-11 17:38:08'),(399,'VISHAL K.

This curiosity led me to observe how energy is being created and converted into other forms and the basic mechanism behind them. This was one of the main reasons for me to choose Physics as my profession.\r\n    Now I wish to pursue my career in solar physics. Also I learned that sun serves as the natural laboratory for plasma physics and particle physics. We know that there are many puzzling phenomena taking place on the atmosphere of sun that are of great importance. When I learned about corona heating problem, the axiomatic fact that the temperature of the corona of the sun is at very high temperature than that of the surface made my curious mind to think and get deep insights about the same. The dominant theories which attributes the heating of magnetic field that stretch across the solar surface and heating of the wave emanating from below the solar surface which carry magnetic energy created more interest and quests in me. As there are some discrepancies with the theories still, I am motivated to get wide knowledge about it. \r\n      As I learned solar eruptions which is also on active research topics in  IUCAA, is the more dramatic space weather effect that occur in association with eruptions of materials from solar atmosphere into interplanetary space.

According to plans, phantom was irradiated from different positions, in two steps  without using filter and with using filter.

From the early age since i remember i like to observe the stars and wondered do they exist during the day time also? There are many things which are unaware to us like the evolution of universe and many hiden mystries. During the course  we came across many unknown things like the variation in the temperature of stars and there evolution ,which is given by the H-R diagram ,classification of galaxy, etc. Astrophysics makes us aware with the celestial objects there existance etc. the events took place in the space which are observed with the telescopes and studied. I have interest in astronomy is the study of the heavenly bodies ,those twinkling stars appears like a diamonds in the sky but they are the giant monsters and actually are very huge then the sun .The galaxies are of different types . Hence, to study these objects i would like to do my career in astrophysics. As i am interested in this subject to enhance  my knowledge.we have performed the practicals on this, using  the CLEA software which deals with the processed data of the observation carried out by the observers and are original ones and are used for the practical course in our lab. There are many unusual things which are strange for us and can be studied by observing them. the black hole , the evolution of universe etc, are some of the examples which are partially known to us they are not exactly recognised .there are many questions for which we are unable answer as the mysterious and to solve them an vast study and observation is required. and also while studying this course number of queries arises in ones mind and i am the one of it  and to satisfy myself i would like to know about the things and would like to search for it.  we also observed the the moons craters which were appeared by the impact of asteroides on its surface.then the things beyond our galaxy must be know to is needed for the future research. the heavenly bodies are vast in number and impossible to gain information about it but making a bright future in it is  the aim of mine.','Yes, I have completed the academic project in astrophysics  named as SURFACE PHOTOMETRY OF NGC3923 under the guidance of our subject teacher Dr. M. K. Patil . NGC3923 is an elliptical type of galaxy on which i fitted the ellipse by using the IRAF software which stands for IMAGE REDUCTION ANALYSIS FASILITY using the linux operating system. Here the model image of the given galaxy was drawn out and later on the ellipse fitted was and also isophote the given galaxy.On the basis of  this project  it showed that the ellipse fitting  can be only done on the elliptical galaxy as NGC3923 is a elliptical galaxy. With the help of model image the residual image and the extinction map was drawn of the available filters of the given galaxy. This project was carried out using the linux as an operating system.

I think if we go on studying about tachyon field we are certainly able to find out answers for the unanswered questions like dark energy,dark matter,dark flow,baryon asymmetry until this era or future.I think It should have been existed like tachyon field, during the Big bang.Peter Higgs predicted about Higgs field in 1964 But he never has been believed to be proven it but in 2012 we proved it.It is believed to be proved the tachyon field some day.','','','','No','Waiting','No','No','2014-09-12 20:16:28'),(434,'Rahul.R','1993-03-29','Male','Indian','rahul.vellanad000@gmail.com','Kunnum Purathu Mele Puthen Veedu,Vellanad,Vellanad P.O,Thiruvananthapuram,Kerala','695543','Thiruvananthapuram','Kerala','+918590512742','Kunnum Purathu Mele Puthen Veedu,Vellanad,Vellanad P.O,Thiruvananthapuram,Kerala','695543','Thiruvananthapuram','Kerala','General','Xth Std','Govt.V&amp;H.S.S Vellanad','State Board',2009,'8A+,2A',90,'XIIth Std','Govt.V&amp;H.S.S Vellanad','State Board',2011,'4A+,2A',92,'B.Tech.','Lourdes Matha College Of Science and Technology','University Of Kerala',2015,'',78,'NULL','','',0,'',0,'B.Tech,Electronics and Communication','2015','Alphonse.D\r\nAsst.Professor\r\n','Chithra .B\r\nAsst.Professor','','No',NULL,'Theory, Observations, Computation','From my childhood I always wonders about the mysteries of the sky.I always dreams about the moon and the success of Neil Amstrong gave great inspiration to my dreams.For that I appeared for the ISAT exam but unfortunately i did not get that.The interest increased when INDIA acheived Chandrayaan and going to achieve Mangalyaan mission.The famous scientist Stephan Hokings wonderful theories and observation always makes me more interested to astrophysics.So i always dream  about to study and explore the mysteries behind the astronomy and astrophysics.For the part of our Main project i installed an open source simulation software SPACE ENGINE which simulates the beauty of space in a 3D form,It further gave boost to the interest.','','','I am preparing for the GATE examination.','No','Rejected','No','No','2014-09-12 20:28:46'),(435,'ALBY PETER','1993-01-01','Female','INDIAN','albypeter1@gmail.com','KUNNATHEL\r\nPURAPUZHA P O\r\nTHODUPUZHA','685583','THODUPUZHA','Kerala','8281930570','ST JOSEPHS COLLEGE(AUTONOMOUS)\r\n36,LANGFORD ROAD\r\nSHANTHINAGAR\r\nBENGALURU ','560027','BANGALORE','Karnataka','General','Xth Std','ST.SEBASTIANS HIGH SCHOOL, PURAPUZHA','BOARD OF PUBLIC EXAM ',2008,'A',82,'XIIth Std','ST.SEBASTIANS HIGHER SECONDARY SCHOOL, VAZHITHALA','HIGHER SECONDARY BOARD',2010,'A',83,'B.Sc.','NEWMAN COLLEGE,THODUPUZHA','M G UNIVERSITY',2013,'B+',77,'M.Sc.','ST.JOSEPHS COLLEGE,BANGALORE','BANGALORE UNIVERSITY',2015,'C',58,'M SC PHYSICS','2015','DR.

The stars ,galaxies, our solar system etc can be studied deeply to overcome our enthusisam. Astronomy is the branch were we can find the facts of creation of our universe and other celestial objects. The stars which seems to be a diamond shining  over the dark night sky, the moon which only can be seen at the night time . The planets of our solar system are studied on their appearance like their masses, colour, constitution in short their physical properties etc. The guest object like the comet are considered as the visitors of our dwelling planet ie. our mother earth. The objects on whose impact the craters are formed on the surface of moon and other planets are named as asteroides ,they are the stone like objects which exist due to the destruction of the planets etc, which are responsible for the creation of craters. The are of different shape and sizes may be huge then the sun or the giant stars. The classification of stars on the  of there temperature, luminosity, colour, size etc,it can be predicted that the stars like the sun are cool stars as their temperature is less about 10,000k or less and these the stars like the moon are hot stars whose temperatures are about 50,000k or more. Then our parent galaxy is a spiral type of galaxy, the galaxies are classified on there physical appearances whether they have the spiral arms or are elliptical or lenticular.These are the some facts to which we are aware of and there are many such mysterious facts which are unknown to us ie. the big bang theory is partially proved, then existance of the guest objects. To know such unusual facts makes me more exicted . So at least to enhance my knowledge in this subject the further study is must hence so i would like to do my career in astrophysics.

To know ourself, where we are and how long our world will be into exist is necessary to know, so i like this subject most. Being a part of this universe its our duty to know about it minutely.

Then that time I saw the programme (which was a serial) regularly, when I read in B.Sc. But in our B.Sc course, we have no paper on this subject. So I search some meterial on Astronomy from google page like, black hole, various types of stars and their size, mass, distance from earth etc and Big bang theory ect. While reading this meterial , I got more interest on Astronomy.\r\n       I am fortunate enough that during previous year (2013), I got a chance to work on this subject as my summer project at S.N.Bose national center for basic science under Dr. Soumen Mondal and I also attain two times sky watching programme. This project work was extremely interesting for me and this give me a quite curiosity in my mind and I want to know this subject Astronomy in details.\r\n     That is why in M.Sc finl year I choose my special paper Astrophysics and Cosmology and also I have done another project on Cosmology under the supervision of Prof. Somenath Chakrabarty.\r\n      Those project work give me a different interest on this subject and that is why in futer I would like to pursue research on Astronomy.','1. My first project on observational Astronomy at S.N. Bose under the supervision of Dr. Soumen Mondal entitled \"Fundamental of Observational Astronomy and Estimation of Fundamental Parameters on Stellar Sourses\". This involves observational techniques, instrumentaion data procecing and the analysis of the observational data. I estimate stellar effective temperature and the bolometric fluxes for F,G and K spectral type stars, using Plancks blackbody function. Using these, estimate angular size and radius knowing the distance from the literature and Atronomical data base (SIMBAD). I estimate also luminosity and mass of the objects using the above parameters and the standard relationships.\r\n2. My second project on Cosmology under the supervision of Prof. Somenath Chakrabarty, entitled \"A SEMI-QUALITATIVE STUDY OF BIG BANG AND CYCLIC UNIVERSE MODEL\".

One of the biggest mystery is the blank sky which is full of opportunities. While reading a book of Astronomy I learnt lots of interesting things like the reason for day and night, constellations, their phases, zodiacs, planetary motions, eclipses etc. I explored more and more sources to learn more about them, more I was attracted to it. I am blessed to belong a place where sky is clear and I am able to enjoy my hobby of sky gazing in night using simple telescope, and photography of celestial objects. Now it?s my inexpensive hobby shared by millions of people mostly the naturalists of the night. After joining graduation I missed my hobby very much due to polluted sky of metro city which tempted me to join an organization Space where I learned Astrometrica software and I join ?All India Asteroid search campaign-2014? in collaboration with International Astronomical Search Collaboration (IASC), USA. There I did some NEO (near earth object) observations. I am further attracted to the sky because how finely Celestial bodies are arranged, moving, maintaining a system, boundaries of the sky, distributions of sky bodies, life signs on other end of the sky and many more including impact of the same on the life on earth both direct as well as indirect.\r\nI love to read about Cosmology, Tensors, Relativity (specially Twin Paradox ), Theory of Big Bang, Stellar Astronomy, Solar Physics ,Radio Astronomy, Planetary System, etc. also the famous topics like Gravitational-wave astronomy and Stellar Nurseries is also very interesting, and I would like to work on these topics in future.\r\nThe branch of physics dealing with celestial objects, the physics, chemistry, and evolution of such objects, and phenomena that originate outside the atmosphere of Earth is Astronomy where the Universe is our laboratory. It provides an opportunity of an alternative approach to the scientific method- observation, simulation, and theory. Astronomy, strike me as one of the most exciting areas of research today. Thanks to new observations, better methods and more powerful simulations that we can now hope to answer, with reasonable confidence, some of the most profound questions ever raised. Astronomy has emerged forever from the old books of mythology to assert itself as an exact science, an unclouded crystal ball of the universe. May be tiny points of light are routes through which we might find answers to some of life?s toughest questions. I would like to be a part of it. With a motive to enter in this field of research, and I wish to be part of INAT which is the premier institute in the field.','I did internship in \"SPACE\" organisation for \"All India Asteroid Search Campaign-2014\" in collaboration with International Astronomical Search Collaboration(IASC),USA.

During my high school education I got interested in Astrophysics through reading some of the popular introductory astrophysics books published by \"Sasthra Sahitya Parishad-Kerala\". They tried to uncover the physics behind all those stuffs in layman terms so that I was able to understand it without great knowledge in physics. Later I tried some English books also. Still I remember a book \"Galaxies\" by John Gribbin for which I took too many days to complete. In addition to that me and two of my friends used to get together in clear nights and gazed the sky overnight. That way I learned to locate some of the constellations in the sky from my friend who knows about almost all those constellations and their constituent stars. Sometimes we go deep and deep by asking questions and discussing. We made small telescopes even. Those Overnight expeditions really hooked me to observational astronomy. \r\nI was also a member of Astronomy Club at Regional Science Center and Planetarium, Calicut. They taught us more physics, like, stellar evolution, Big Bang, Telescopes..etc..\r\nHaving done two summer fellowships in Astronomy and astrophysics I could explore more physics in it. It made me to wonder how information about far distant worlds is deciphered from barely feeble signatures it leave for us. As I explored more physics in it, the more I got interested in. This helped me to choose to attend some of the workshops on data analysis techniques in Astrophysics. The lectures coupled with hands on sessions gave me more insights to the point of my wonder. Again summer fellowships for the second time gave me more different flavors of some techniques for data analysis. I am sure that I couldnt understand whatever I learned completely, but, it has doubled my enthusiasm.\r\nThe way I got interested and getting more interest in astronomy, I can say, through involving in different kinds of activities and exercises related to the field. Here in Pondicherry also, Astronomy club is platform where we regularly have discussions, observations and other activities. I always like inferring the unknown from known facts. That is always enjoyable and we can end up in satisfaction. Also, I understand astronomy is all about knowing how we, the stardust, came into being, where we came from and where we going.','I have done a project titled \"Darkmatter and Gravitational Lensing\" under the supervision of Prof. Pushpa Khare, IUCAA as an Indian Academy of Sciences Summer Research Fellow during April-December 2012.  It was purely a reading project in which I went through a number of books learning basic stuffs. It really helped me.\r\nIn this year summer also I did a project \"Associated absorption line systems: as tool to understand the cool Gas outflows\" under the guidance of Dr. Hum Chan at ARIES, Nainital. I analyzed the reduced spectroscopic data of 16 Blazars by fitting continuum and line identification using IDL Language. Data have been collected from ESO-UVES Archives. Additionally I was able to reduce real data of some 10 Blazars that my guide has collected with the help of Himalayan Chandra Telescope.  It helped me to learn some techniques for data reduction.','I am a recipient of INSPIRE Scholarship for Higher Education instituted by the Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India.','','No','Selected','No','No','2014-09-13 23:22:46'),(456,'chetan sharma','1992-07-12','Male','Indian','chetansharma6306@gmail.com',' 38 2/3, Shahid Bhagat Singh Pandey Nagar,\r\n Dumping Road, Mulund (west)','400080','Mumbai','Maharashtra','00',' THE INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE,\r\n Madam Cama Road, Fort','400001','Mumbai','Maharashtra','OBC','Xth Std','RGHSchool, Mulund','Maharashtra Board',2008,'Distic',83,'XIIth Std','Ramniranjan Jhunjhunwala College, Ghatkoar','Maharashtra Board',2010,'2nd',49,'B.Sc.','Ramniranjan Jhunjhunwala College, Ghatkopar','Mumbai University',2013,'2nd',59,'M.Sc.','The Institute Of Science, Mumbai','Mumbai University',2015,'1st',60,'M.Sc. and Electronics','2015','Dr.Kiran Kolwankar,\r\nRamniranjan Jhujhunwala College, Ghatkopar (w), Mumbai-400077,\r\nProfessor and Vice president of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics','Mrs. Geeta Mathur,\r\nRamniranjan Jhunjhunwala College, Ghatkpoar (w), Mumbai-400077,\r\nProfessor and President of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics','RA','Yes','I was applied to VSRP 2013.','Theory, Observations, Computation','I am interested  in astronomy &amp; astrophysics.\r\nThis field is currently growing up and in future it is better option.

I started looking at the pictures in astronomy books before I could even read. The pictures were beautiful,fascinating and intriguing. As I grew up I wanted to know all about what those pictures meant.I am still learning. Perhaps i like astronomy because we are personally a way of the Universe experiencing itself,or that we are all made of star-stuff,as Carl Sagan so elegantly put it. Astronomy is a science that seeks to explain everything that we observe in the Universe,from the comets and planets in our own solar system to distant galaxies to the echoes of the Big Bang. By studying the cosmos beyond our own planet,we can understand where we came from,where we are going,why is the universe organized as it is?Are we alone? And how physics works under conditions which are impossible to recreate on Earth. In astronomy,the Universe is our laboratory! Astronomy provides an example of an alternative approach to the scientific method- observation,simulation,and theory. It is an enjoyable,inexpensive hobby for millions of people- the naturalists of the night. But above all astronomy has shown us how insignificant the human physical existence is,and how great the human mind with an intelligence that is now embracing a dazzling range of phenomena,from the astronomically large to the infinitely small. I have very little doubt that what astronomy will still give us in the future will dwarf all of its past contributions by comparison. I am motivated by curiosity and a deep desire to understand some of the grandest and most beautiful phenomena in the universe,as well as a desire to share these wonders with others.

When I look up at the night sky, a wave of queries passes through my mind. What the stars are? How they shine and where from they come? \r\n              From ancient time, human minds have been searching for the ultimate answer of the mysterious question mark regarding the stars. As Astrophysics is the tool for study of the structural and evolutionary behaviours of the stars, it is interesting and exciting for me to understand what the constituents of a star are and how one can reveal the secrets of various stellar properties. \r\n          Being a student of astrophysics, when I look up at the night sky through a telescope, I amaze observing the Moon, Saturn, Venus, Vega, Arcturus etc. planets and stars. I am motivated to see how we can extract the different properties of stars, life time and their evolutionary track from the H-R diagram. Involved in some exercise in SDSS Sky Server, given as assignment by one of my Astrophysics teacher, I have become ambitious to use a rich material of astrophysical data to uncover the Universe.\r\n            The most important part of Astrophysics is to reveal the mystery of evolution of the Universe and to know the fate of the Universe.

Their centre often harbour supermassive blackholes that can give rise to quasors and active galactic nuclei, which are some of the brightest objects in the universe. Their stars contain a record of the past history of galaxy and by studying galaxies at diffrent distances we look back in time and can reconstruct how they evolve.\r\nGalaxies form through the gravitational collapse of clouds intergalactic matter. Small galaxies merge together to form large ones, building up a rich hierarchy of structures in the process. The stars and active nuclei in galaxies interact with their environment by pervading it with radiation, by polluting it with heavy elements and by driving supersonic winds into intergalactic space.\r\nThe study about the galaxies is very important in order to find out another place where life is present. If we got such things then it will be the biggest achievement forever in the world of science.\r\nThe further and further study of galaxy may give the idea about an atom or an electron. The further and further study of galaxy and by comparing the galaxy and an atom, we may give new idea about electron .

Attending a few workshops also helped me get an insight into Astronomy.\r\n\r\nDuring my first year of under graduation, in 2010, I got an opportunity to attend Vijyoshi (Vigyan Jyoti Shivir) Camp held at IISc. The lecture given by Prof. Thanu Padmanabhan on Gravity and Cosmos motivated me to read introductory books on Astronomy. I also  attended the lectures given in IUCAA as part of Radio Astronomy Winter School in 2011. These series of lectures covered broad areas in Astronomy like Distances and Magnitudes, Radio Galaxies, Large scale structure of the Universe, Evolution of Stars, Solar Physics,etc. Also, a lot of intriguing questions were put forward and a few speakers discussed their research. These lectures introduced me to research in Astronomy. The course in Astronomy and Astrophysics taught to us by Dr. Ramana Athreya and the core topics I got exposed to like Mathematical Methods, Electrodynamics, Classical Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics, Special Relativity, Cosmology and Statistical Mechanics also helped me to appreciate the subject by introducing me to the physics behind Astronomy. \r\n\r\nI find it amazing that the distance scales in Astronomy range from about 10 km which is the radius of a neutron star to about 28 Giga parsec which is the diameter of the observable universe. The densities range from 10^(17) kg per cubic meter in a neutron star to about 10^(-28) kg per cubic meter in inter cluster medium. The vastness of the subject and the scope for interesting research in this field is the main motivating factor for me to pursue Astronomy and Astrophysics.\r\n\r\nI am also interested in Condensed matter Physics, Statistical Mechanics and Plasma Physics and I believe that the universe is the biggest laboratory where one needs to apply various branches of Physics . One of the reasons I want to do research in Astronomy is that for me Astronomy is not an abstract subject. We receive signals from the universe and we now have various techniques to detect these signals even the extremely faint ones..We have information from millions of years to check our predictions,theory and models and come up with new theories as we get more and more data. I believe we have all the data we need. We just have to look closely enough. The present day technology, telescopes like GMRT, MWA,SKA and surveys like the NVSS,SDSS,etc give enormous scope for this.\r\n\r\nThe project I am currently involved in deals with extended emission in Galaxies. One gets a lot of information from the integrated spectral index and also the spectral index maps like the approximate age of the relativistic electrons and also the dynamics of the cluster.There are a lot of questions which one could think of like what is the actual mechanism responsible for the emission?\r\nThis kind of research in Astronomy adds to our knowledge of the universe and there is more such research yet to be done.','I worked with Dr.Ramana Athreya on Pulsars. During the three month project, I referred to standard textbooks and scientific papers on various Pulsar Models.\r\n\r\nI worked with Dr.Yogesh Wadadekar for three months. For my project, we identified the radio sources (from VIPERS catalog) on GMRT XLSS image. Once identified,we made cutouts of the images of the individual sources and we tried median stacking these cutouts to detect radio source.\r\n\r\nI am currently working with Dr. Dwakaranath. We tried to detect HI line from DEEP field(GMRT data). I used the software Astronomical Image Processing System (AIPS) to produce images.We are now looking at minihalo emission from A1795 using CASA.  The aim of this project is to detect the emission at 625MHz, 235MHz and 150MHz, compare it with the emission at 1.4 GHz and also compare the radio images with X-ray and Optical images.

I have been deeply interested to unravel the mysteries of the universe. My main motive is to carry out research in the areas of high energy astrophysics and astronomical objects such as black holes, quasars, neutron stars etc which will enhance our understanding of the universe. Also, i am interested in the technological and computational applications in the field of astrophysics and astronomy.\r\n    My interest lies in the study of matter at high densities,temperatures,velocities.I want to work in the current research areas of high energy astrophysics such as the exploding supernovae,neutron stars,pulsars,gamma ray bursts.I want to work on the theoretical as well as computational aspects of these subjects.My particular area of interest is in the study of astrophysical particle accelerations such as in relativistic jets,accretion disks ,high energy emissions in pulsars,gamma ray bursts.I want to explore the theories behind such phenomena.Also since computational activities can make it easier and better to solve such problems, i want to work with them.I work in the area of computational fluid dynamics for solving engineering problems. I am interested in extending and applying it in the area of relativistic astrophysical flows such as relativistic shock tube problems, dust in fall, accretion in black holes,neutron stars etc and in relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic flows as in case of corona mass ejection.i am also keen to work on other numerical methods for the same.\r\n        Another keen interest that I carry is in the study of compact objects like black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs etc. They are also a very important source to understand different physical phenomena in the universe. I would like to work on physical and mathematical theories that study these objects such as the relativistic gravitational theories.The high energy conditions at the beginning of the universe which involved the formation of fundamental forces and particles of nature is something which amazes me. So I want to contribute by exploring and analyzing the physical theories governing the formation of the early universe.\r\n         As a mechanical engineering student, I am interested in the field of optical telescopes. Since observation is an important aspect of astronomy and astrophysics, I would like to contribute towards construction and building of optical telescopes which is a great boon for astronomy and astrophysics.i want to work on techniques and ideas that could improve the observational techniques in optical astronomy and can therefore be able to gather large and accurate amount of data from distant objects.\r\n         Astrophysics has always fascinated me and will continue doing so.My goal is to have a better understanding of the universe and its related phenomena. ','Yes i have worked in the area of Quantum Mechanics under the guidance of Dr. Zafar Ahmed at BARC, Mumbai. My work was related to scattering and resonance states present in one dimensional potentials .The potentials considered were two piece potentials with rising potentials on one end. The complex energy eigenvalues giving rise to resonances and time delay were obtained. I also worked on avoided crossings in potentials.Apart from that i have worked on the presence of zero energy Eigenstates in rectangular wells and double wells.As a result of this research i have been able to be a co-author of 4 papers currently in the physics Arxiv: 1408.2367,1408.0231,1406.4761,1401.8070.\r\n      I have also worked in MATLAB in the simulation of mechanisms of four bar linkages as a mechanical project.\r\n','Merit cum means scholarship provided by the institute i am currently studying in, to students who secured 90% and above in their class 12th exams.\r\n   i secured third prize in the K.V.S regional science exhibition for a project on alternative sources of energy and represented Bangalore region in Jawaharlal Nehru National science exhibition.','','No','Selected','No','No','2014-09-16 15:23:05'),(521,'patil vandana baliram','1982-06-07','Female','indian','patil.vandana40@gmail.com',' c 202 sai vision  next to govind gardan pimple saudagar pune','411027','pune','Maharashtra','02027405218',' c 202 sai vision  next to govind gardan pimple saudagar pune','411027','pune','Maharashtra','General','Xth Std','shri ram highscool','kolhapur board',1997,'A',61,'XIIth Std','SHRI am school','kolh apur board',2000,'pass',45,'B.Sc.','vivekanand college kolhapur','shivaji university kol',2005,'O',78,'M.Sc.','shivaji university kolhapur','shivaji university kol',2007,'A',0,'MSC','2007','Dr. s.h.

I started looking at the pictures in astronomy books before I could even read. The pictures were beautiful,fascinating and intriguing. As I grew up I wanted to know all about what those pictures meant.I am still learning. Perhaps i like astronomy because we are personally a way of the Universe experiencing itself,or that we are all made of star-stuff,as Carl Sagan so elegantly put it. Astronomy is a science that seeks to explain everything that we observe in the Universe,from the comets and planets in our own solar system to distant galaxies to the echoes of the Big Bang. By studying the cosmos beyond our own planet,we can understand where we came from,where we are going,why is the universe organized as it is?Are we alone? And how physics works under conditions which are impossible to recreate on Earth. In astronomy,the Universe is our laboratory! Astronomy provides an example of an alternative approach to the scientific method- observation,simulation,and theory. It is an enjoyable,inexpensive hobby for millions of people- the naturalists of the night. But above all astronomy has shown us how insignificant the human physical existence is,and how great the human mind with an intelligence that is now embracing a dazzling range of phenomena,from the astronomically large to the infinitely small. I have very little doubt that what astronomy will still give us in the future will dwarf all of its past contributions by comparison. I am motivated by curiosity and a deep desire to understand some of the grandest and most beautiful phenomena in the universe,as well as a desire to share these wonders with others. To me, research is often a bridge to an ambitious goal - a bridge that needs to be crossed in steps..\r\n\r\nAstrophysics strike me as one of the most exciting areas of research today. Thanks to new observations,better methods and more powerful simulations that we can now hope to answer,with reasonable confidence,some of the most profound questions ever raised.Astronomy has emerged forever from the old books of mythology to assert itself as an exact science,an unclouded crystal ball of the universe.

The energy scales and extreme environments in the universe cannot properly be simulated in our earth based labs. So by studying about the celestial objects we can gain a better understanding of the Physics at these extreme scales. \r\nInherently I think that some humans (not all) are explorers...some are hunter gatherers...and these humans are typically inquisitive and want to know the how and why behind what they observe. So we end up exploring and hunting  and gathering information and what better quest than delving into the depths of the solar system or the universe....that is where the unknowns the truth the missing God the ultimate frontier lies. \r\nHomo sapience and the Universe is the central problem of science. Why the Universe is appropriate for homo sapiens? Studying the Cosmos we partially understand the answer to the question.\r\nHumans are naturally curious and the cosmos is the biggest mystery. Certainly survival of the Human race is another reason  because unless humans become space faring any extinction level event that may happen on Earth would wipe us out like the dinosaurs. \r\nIt is the  curiosity that human kind have since its early existence explore the environment where we are.

There after I got selected in JRF- Project in Delhi Technological University as a Project Assistant . After 2 months of work there my superviser send me to IUAC atomic physics group for further work and paticipate in Beam Foil Experiments. Since then I am working in IUAC and attending its Phd. Course Modules.','No',NULL,'Theory, Observations, Computation','As a young boy at school I was really facinated by subjects like Astrophysics, Astronomy and Cosmology and this had actually motivated me to take these subjects as specialization subjects in my MSc. Physics. At University of Delhi these subjects were taught by excellent faculty like Prof. Daksh Lohiya, Prof Patrick Dasgupta and Prof. Shobhit Mahajan. To my memory I thoroughly enjoyed every moment in the class at that time because according to me these subjects actually have all the ingredients to have a big-bang of new thoughts in anyones mind in search of the possible explanations for the bizarre phenomenas occurring in the univese all the time starting from stars to quasars. The beauty of these subjects is that all thee domains of research field like observation, experiment and theory comes into play and I feel that this very aspect of research in these field offer a wonderful opportunity to train any motivated young scholar who is starting its reseach carrier. Keeping all these things in mind and while deciding my specialization in MSc. I had opted for Laser and Spectroscopy lab along with Astrophysics and Cosmology as laser an only scientific instrument that is in use to make interferometer instruments used for LIGO and future LISA projects related to Cosmology and reson for spectroscopy is that it is highly indispensable for Astronomy and Astrophysics. \r\n\r\nAfter MSc. I joined Atomic Physics Group of Inter University Accelerator Center(IUAC), New Delhi as a JRF - Project Assistant, there I had actively participated in making a VUV to Visible range spectrometer work which was earlier in a completely brokendown state. We installed all the required components of that specrometer starting with stepper motor for precision movement of grating and shaft encoder for recording the wavelents and focussing of the spectometer and then finally the spectrometer was calibrated with standard mercury course in visible region and He- discharge lamp in VUV region. So all this work provides me extensive training in experimental physics and equipped me with skills to work efficiently and confidence to take up challenging projects. Along with that spectrometer work I had been part of 5 experiments performed by atomic physics group with ion beam. During these experiments I learned safe operation of X-ray, solid state and gas based position sensitive proportional counter detectors along with its complete electronics using NIM-Standard Modules and complete Data Acquisition ystem based on CAMAC system. After reading your application I realized that this Ph.D program turn out to be wonderful opportunity for a person who loves both theory and experiment and at IUCAA I will also get the opportunity to work in observational astronomy. I would therefore like to join your research group as a Ph.D student in order to fully devote my time on some unsolved problems related to Astronomy and Astrophysics. I am quite sure about my abilites and strengths and I promise, if given a chance, I will prove an asset to the group.','Presently I am a JRF- Project fellow working in atomic physics group of IUAC.

I have always gravitated towards languages and math. More than as a means of communication, I enjoyed languages as way to gain insight into our world and culture through books and sociolinguistics. I am an avid reader and dont miss a single opportunity to learn something new. As I grew older, I came to appreciate the beauty of mathematics as a language of the world around me. I saw functional relationships and algebra in everything. Math with its perfection took the place of God for me. That is to say I look to math when things dont make sense and consider it to be the only thing I can trust in contention. \r\nAlthough abstract math comes much easier to me, engineering mathematics taught me the importance of practical math when concepts like Fourier Transform, Bessel Functions and Vector Calculus came to life in the form of time-frequency transformation, drums and electromagnetic waves. Engineering also added more languages to my knowledge base in the form of software and hardware programming languages, through which I understood machines devices and algorithms better.\r\nIn this fashion I came to feel more and more compelled to reduce the fundamental aspects of our universe into mathematical equations. My interest in cosmology started here as I began to explore the makeup of the universe. I devoured books on the subject, watched documentaries, scoured the internet and realized how much we still dont know about the universe. This means there is still so much more to be found.\r\nLogically, Theoretical Cosmology seems to be my calling.\r\nI believe that by exploring the universe at the largest and smallest scales, we come closer to understanding at once both the insignificance and the significance of the human race. In this field, each new answer opens up a whole new world of questions  sometimes a new subject altogether. A single new theory, a single unexpected observation can change the perception of the entire world. At one point in time you could hold a fundamental piece of knowledge that nobody else in the world knows.\r\nThis course in Astrophysics and Astronomy fits my needs better than any other course offered in our country as I would like to pursue theoretical research in an intellectual, stimulating and independent environment.','Being an engineering student, I have done several small projects on both hardware and software platforms.\r\nHardware: Brake Failure Indicator, Pseudo-random LED die, Audio and Power Amplifiers, Oscillators, Modulators etc\r\nSofttware: Simulations of Byte Comparator,Code Converters and other digital circuits on Verilog HDL platform using Xilinx Tools\r\nAmplitude Modulation, Piano Simulation, Waveform Generator etc on LabVIEW, a graphical programming platform\r\nbesides ongoing project work in VLSI design on Cadence Tools.\r\nI have no formal research experience but I do informal research from time to time on topics of my interest outside academia like evolutionary aspects of sociology and behaviorism.','I have received distinctions every year in school for my academics.

I want to use this idea to investigate the abundance of star spot on the surface of 28 Cas.-HIP 442, spectral type G8III-IV(sun like star). Detection techniques may include photometry, spectroscopy, Doppler imaging or Doppler-Zeeman imaging.\r\n 			Star spots can be detected by searching for photometric light-curve variations whose period is the same as the rotation period of the star, provided the surface in homogeneities have lifetimes extending over several rotations. In order to deduce star spot properties from photometric data both forward method (sometimes called spot modelling or light curve modelling) and inverse methods (like matrix light curve inversion) can be used. If there are spots available and further spectroscopic features are studied, it can provide us the information about the temperature differences on the surface and the spot (by line depth ratio method or molecular lines method).The Doppler technique (which uses a one-to-one correspondence between wavelength position across a broadened absorption line profile and spatial position across the stellar disc) can be used to determine a spots size, shape, and position along with rotational and migratory motion on the disc in a better way. The procedure of merging Doppler imaging to polarimetric measurements would help us to detect the magnetic field associated with the individual star spot. Moreover, combining the photometry and Doppler imaging can be used to study star spots lifetimes.\r\n 			 If all the spots are considered simultaneously, it will help us to understand the facts like spot occupancy, latitudinal distribution of spots, radial and azimuthal magnetic field structure of the star spots. Information regarding phases of rotation of star spots and differential rotation of star itself can also be concluded. If long-term photometry is involved we can also comment on the information of star spot cycle.\r\n 			If there is any presence of planetary system around the concerned star (data can be collected from COROT or KEPLER, if available), what effect on the planetary system does the spot have due to its temperature and magnetic fluctuations (like in XX Trianguli (HD12545) 20% of the star is filled with spots)? Extending this to find what is the effective temperature and magnetic flux at the so called Habitable Zone. Furthermore I want to investigate the presence of faculae on the same by photometric and spectroscopic measurements.\r\n 			The reason for selecting the 28 Cas.-HIP 442 is, in virtue of its position near the north pole, Cassiopeia is available for 5  6 months for observation on the Indian night sky. The spectral type of this star is G8III-IV, which implies, it is comparable to solar mass, radius and luminosity according to the HR diagram.\r\n','Currently working on FRACTAL ANALYSIS OF LEAF VENNATION. We have chosen, in this case, peepal tree (Ficus religiosa). By trial and error we have selected this, as the veins can be very clearly observed and computationally analysed after photography. Mandelbrot (1983) defined a fractal set as a set for which the Hausdorff dimension (Dh) is greater than its topological dimension (DT). The HausdorffBesicovitch dimension Dh is defined as the logarithmic ratio between the number N of an objects internal homotheties and the reciprocal of the common ratio r of this homothety. We are calculating fractal dimension, by different methods and trying to figure out a new method to calculate fractal dimension and compare the results. For comparison mainly we are using power spectrum method and differential box counting method.','I did not received any awards but I attended a few symposium/school that I want to mention:\r\n1.

At that time we used to sleep on terrace. I used to gaze at the sky and try to locate the constellations and think about our Solar System. During my graduation, I started studying more about the basics of Astronomy, studied in Cosmogony about nebular hypothesis for our Solar System and its major demerits. One of which is the retrograde rotation of Venus and the tilt of the axis of rotation of the planets. According to nebular theory, all the components of our Solar System should rotate in the same manner. According to many theorists, the collision between Venus and some meteor of comparable size should account for its retrograde rotation. But, I think of this scenario in a different manner. May be I am wrong as this is my first time when I am expressing my thoughts on this topic. In my opinion, planets can rotate in any direction. I think of rotation of planets analogous to a study that i first saw on discovery channel  that has been carried out in last couple of years that if we observe the rotation of water in a sink, it can drain in clockwise or anti-clockwise rotation regardless of either hemisphere of the Earth, i.e., Northern, Southern, Eastern or Western. Similarly, planetesimals can be thought of as a sink and accreting dust on planetesimals as water, so it can rotate in any direction irrespective of the rotation of the protoplanetary disk. Like Earth rotation has no effect on the rotation of draining water in the sink. Another thing that I have thought about is the characteristics of the Solar dust. There might be some chemical, physical property of the solar dust which triggers the planetesimals to grow into planets and most of the times they remain as it is. Then I started reading about Solar Dust and I found that most of its studies are done using spectroscopy of the interstellar clouds. And I took Spectroscopy as one of my specialization. At my personal level me and one of my friend have got a Newtonian Reflector (F/5). I have done many night sky observations, but not deep sky observation due to the light and air pollution in Delhi. But I am soon planning to go to my village and do astrography and deep sky observations. At last I will say that I am truly dedicated to astrophysics and astrography. And it will be a great uplift in my career if given an opportunity to pursue phd in your Institution.','Doing research work on my own on standing water waves and  I will bring it under my professor in future.','Participated and qualified National Science Olympiad.

At that time, I wondered how it could be possible to name them because all looked the same to my inexperienced eyes. My paternal grandfather, who was a mathematician by interest, was always seen with a calculator in his hand, calculating the time of solar eclipses in history in pursuit of finding the exact date and time of death of Jesus Christ. And my interest in Astronomy got doubled once he started explaining me about the solar system, eclipse and the calculations behind finding the exact time of eclipse etc.\r\n\r\nWhen I grew up, I understood that all stars were not really stars but some of them were planets, reflecting the light \r\nof the sun.

I am currently doing a year long internship under Prof. Jayaram Chengaluru.','Theory','Before starting even my undergraduate studies, I was once given an opportunity to work in a research topic of my choice for one summer (thanks to the KVPY fellowship program of the Indian Institute of Sciences). Out of childhood fascination for astronomy, I chose astrophysics. The scientist I was to work under, Dr. P.K. Suresh, though initially perplexed about what research he could make a high school student do, suggested I plot the COBE satellite data and understand why it fits into the black body radiation pattern. Doing that project, I experienced the joy of discovering something through my own work rather than reading it from a text book. True, Newton proved that the gravity that keeps us on Earth also rules the distant stars and planets; but the simplicity of science was more evident to me when I discovered it for myself. This convinced me that science research was what I actually wanted to do.\r\n\r\nI was into my second year of graduation when I got another opportunity to explore the beauty of astronomy. At the Radio Astronomy Winter School in NCRA, Pune I discovered that it\'s not just looking at the starts in wonderment that led us to the discoveries of today; analysing tons of data and making meaning out of it was a different feeling of accomplishment. Among a number of experiments was one where we measured the Doppler shift of the H-21cm line for a number of stars   in the galaxy and plotted the rotation curve of the galaxy. I stared at the plot, amazed at the brilliance of how one could come to a tangible conclusion through data about a quantity that was not visible.\r\n\r\nAs a DAAD fellow in 2013, I worked at the Max Planck institute for Radio Astronomy under Dr. Ramesh Karuppasamy, and once again discovered joy in the small things. The instrument I rebuilt was designed to receive pulsar signals at very high frequencies where dispersion measure could be neglected. The simplicity of the design, though my advisor\'s idea, impressed me immensely. Later, I also worked on a small part of the back-end of the Ooty radio telescope under Dr. Jayaram Chengalur which I really enjoyed. \r\n\r\nCurrently I am working under Dr. Jayaram Chengalur, on the dark matter content of galaxies  a more theoretical project than the ones I have taken up so far, but I find myself absorbed by the challenge of finding a solution to a problem that seems straightforward and mundane at first, but once you start peeling off the layers, the problem just becomes more beautiful. \r\n\r\nMy experience so far has told me what I always knew to be true; my yearning to know more about this world, about its deepest and most fundamental secrets, is something that only astronomy can satisfy. Because only when we choose to look at the big picture will our quest for all encompassing knowledge be satisfied. And my quest has just begun.','1.

At the beginning, definitely I wondered about Astrophysics and Astronomy because of fascinating stars, planets out there in the vast Universe, Mysterious Nebulae, Big Bang itself and so on. But then with passing of time and during my college days, I started learning Physics behind Star formation, stellar atmosphere, extraterrestrial life, beginning of the universe or even the concept of multiverse. Then I started relating each topic of my physics course with Astrophysics, especially with the subjects Quantum Mechanics and Nuclear Physics, and then read about QFT, Quantum gravity, and basic principle of Quantum world- Uncertainty, and in Nuclear Physics, particularly the Elementary Particle Physics drawn my attention. Then I was introduced to Electromagnetic Theory, I came to know about Plasma state, CMB, etc. Read about the Black Hole Thermodynamics and its Laws, although not in much detail. The more I read; I tried to understand the theory behind the nature, the Universe, and thus developed more interest in it. Even, topics like the presence of ether medium, Gravitational Lensing, Vacuum Energy still puzzle me. Then due to my project work on Photometric Analysis on Eclipsing Binary star Systems, I gained a more theoretical and computational knowledge behind them. And now I want to know everything about the Universe, about the time before the Big Bang, when all the four basic forces of nature were united, about the QED, QFD then GUT and atlast about the TOE.','From first year onwards, I have been working on my research paper on Analysis and Modelling of Light Curves of Eclipsing Binary Star Systems, using PHOEBE, Physics Of Eclipsing BinariEs. I have worked on many astronomical computation softwares like NOAO-IRAF (Image Reduction And Analysis Facility), ESO-MIDAS, PHOEBE, CLEA, Aladin, and softwares like GNUplot and R (Statistical Computing Software), and Computer Languages like C, C++, IDL (Interactive Data Language). I had worked on several Astronomical Archival Databases.

The universe to us is merely a collection of photons with energy and frequency. And a proper scientific analysis of those leads to the mapping of the universe and sheds light the internal mechanisms of it.

It left deep impact underneath me mostly unconsciously, I believe.\r\n When I just completed my 12th standard in the summer vacation itself I started giving private tuitions to high school students. As a teacher I also joined a coaching institute, used to teach a batch of about 40 students. There I taught Mathematics and Physics for almost two and a half years. Sometimes during teaching classes I used to tell my students about Stars, Black Holes, Big bang,and surprisingly they used to pay more attention to this part of the class.I think Astronomy is the best science to engender interest toward science in children. During that period of life I realized that teaching Physics is one of my favorite things to be engaged in. In addition to that, now since last 3 months at IIT Bombay I have been teaching Mathematics, as volunteer in IITians? initiative Abhyasika, to small kids of Phulenagar slums which is adjacent to IIT?s campus.\r\n  Further, to boost up my interest and knowledge in astrophysics I decided to attend Summer school of Physics and Astrophysics at solar observatory of IIA at Kodaikanal.\r\n  To get some real life challenges of research,in the last summer vacation, I took up project on Bullet Cluster under supervision of Prof. D. Narasimha. During the project I faced various problems with software usage, coding, lack of knowledge of Fluid Dynamics and Plasma Physics. After spending almost two months with no fruitful results Prof. Narasimha suggested switch to another topic, namely ?Gravitational lensing by Kerr Black Holes?. I have been still working on the second project but at very slow pace due to academic load. As name suggests the aim is to calculate photon geodesics around rotating black holes in resulting space-time. In fact, I am writing a research paper on Kerr Black holes as one of my class assignments. \r\n    My first project, however, was not successful, but I learnt quite a lot. I learnt how to use MATLAB, acquired some coding skills, how to approach a problem and two of most important things I learnt are; First, what things one requires to succeed in a particular problem and second, what challenges researchers have to face while doing their research. For example, if you don?t have a specific knowledge about a particular topic, then you have to look up at various resources available and exploit them efficiently, contact some experts etc.\r\n  Theoretical aspects of High Energy Astrophysics are my current area of interest. Since NCRA and IUCAA are two of the best institutes in India especially devoted to astrophysics and astronomy, and affiliation of persons as faculties like Prof. Narlinkar, Prof. Dipankar Bhattacharya, Prof. Padmanabhan, to name a few, surely and undoubtedly proves that NCRA and IUCAA are great place to carry out research in the whole nation.','I attended Summer school of Physics and Astrophysics at solar observatory of IIA at Kodaikanal in 2012.\r\nLast summer vacation,I took up project on Bullet Cluster under supervision of Prof. D.Narasimha.The objective of this project was to study the shock formation resulting from collision of constituent galaxy clusters which have relative velocity of about 5000 Km/s toward each other and try to match the result with observation.After spending almost two months with no fruitful results he suggested switch to another topic,?Gravitational lensing by Kerr Black Holes?. I have been still working on the second project but at very slow pace due to academic load. The aim is to calculate photon geodesics around rotating black holes in resulting space-time.\r\nFurthermore,I have been learning general theory of relativity and how to write codes on Mathematica to crack null geodesic problems,because project on Gravitational lensing and my M.Sc. project both require rigorous knowledge of GTR.','INSPIRE scholarship since 2010 from Department of Science and Technology, for  being in top 1% in 12th standard throughtout Uttar Pradesh.\r\nAmong top 25 candidates in NGPE-2013 organised by Indian Association of Physics teachers.\r\n','GRE: 316 with 168(95%) in Quantitative section,\r\nJAM 2013: AIR 75,\r\nNGPE-2013: among top 25.','Yes','Selected','No','No','2014-09-17 03:17:57'),(555,'SUSHANT KUMAR THAKUR','1993-01-10','Male','INDIAN','sushantnetarhat@gmail.com','INDIRA NAGAR, CIRCULAR ROAD, DEOGHAR','814112','DEOGHAR','Jharkhand','+918092497839','BIRLA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, MESRA, ','835215','RANCHI','Jharkhand','General','Xth Std','RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL NETARHAT','JHARKHAND STATE BOARD',2009,'',89,'XIIth Std','DOON PUBLIC SCHOOL, DHANBAD','CBSE',2011,'',89,'B.E.','BIRLA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, MESRA RANCHI','DEEMED UNIVERSITY',2015,'',78,'NULL','','',0,'',0,'Pursuing Bachelor of Engineering (BE) from Production Engineering branch','2015','Dr. Joyjeet Ghose,\r\nPh.D., M.Prod.

I have decided to pursue research work in the field of radio astronomy. This statement of purpose presents in front of you my academic background, my research interests and explains my decision for choosing your institute for research work. \r\nSince my early childhood, I was interested in communication and radio astronomy ,when I saw discovery channel for the first time in my life, I realized that practical knowledge is far superior than theoretical knowledge. In pursuit of my dream, I took up B. Tech course in Information Technology from Institute of Radio Physics and Electronics, which is one of the best colleges in India in terms of quality education. In my undergraduate course, I learnt electronics, communication principles (both wireless and wires) and along with that Digital Signal Processing and computer programming languages like C and MATLAB.The years at undergraduate level had been truly enriching for me. It helped me to get confidence and acquire some most important knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue study and fulfill dream , I have appeared and qualified GATE Examination in ECE in 2012 and got admitted to M. Tech in Radio Physics and Electronics from University of Calcutta, one of the most prestigious Universities in India. In M. Tech my specialization is Space Science and Communication Technology. In M. Tech, I have learnt Satellite Based Navigation Technology, Remote Sensing, Space Climatology and Weather and its impact on global communication and Navigation Systems. It increased my interest towards higher study more and more. \r\nThe interest of working in radio astronomy growing me from 1st semester of M.tech. Since then I am finding the opportunity to  direct my further study in the field of radio astronomy to get a better understanding and knowledge in radio astronomy.   \r\n\r\nI have completed  M. Tech project titled A  STUDY OF AMPLITUDE AND PHASE SCINTILLATION AND TO DEVELOP  MODELS OF AMPLITUDE AND PHASE SCINTILLATION NEAR THE ANOMALY CREST REGION FROM GPS DATA which aims to predict the effects of amplitude scintillation on Satellite Based communication and navigation systems. \r\n\r\nI am certain that my research interest will get a clear direction under the guidance of the distinguished teachers of your department. Your institutes excellent research facility and the recognition of your institute at the global level inspired me to apply here at your institute.   \r\n\r\nI have decided to contribute at least a small drop to this vast ocean of radio astronomy. A PhD degree is the first step that I have chosen to initiate my personal contribution towards becoming a researcher-cum-teacher. It will help me to come closer to my goal. \r\n','','','GATE 2012 ECE \r\nSC CATEGORY\r\nSCORE-290\r\nMARKS OBTAINED-18.67\r\nCUT OFF MARKS-16.67\r\nDue to this gate qualification I got scholarship during m.tech study.',NULL,'Selected','No','No','2014-09-17 14:14:54'),(566,'Harshali','1990-07-04','Female','indian','harshali.deore4@gmail.com','agasti kothrud ,paud road pune','411038','Pune','Maharashtra','8407996584','pict ,pune satara road ,dhanakawadi pune','411043','Pune','Maharashtra','OBC','Xth Std','Jijamata girls Highschool satana','Maharashtra StateBoard',2005,'distin',76,'XIIth Std','Maharashtra State Board','Maharashtra StateBoard',2007,'first',62,'B.E.','PVPIT','Pune University',2011,'second',59,'M.E.','PICT','Pune University',0,'8.75',0,'M.E(E&amp;Tc)','2014','Na','na','','No',NULL,'Theory, Observations, Computation','hese\r\n deparments are need to be with keen study .

A related but distinct subject, cosmology, is concerned with studying the universe as a whole.[1]\r\n\r\nAstronomy is one of the oldest sciences. Prehistoric cultures have left astronomical artifacts such as the Egyptian monuments and Nubian monuments, and early civilizations such as the Babylonians, Greeks, Chinese, Indians, Iranians and Maya performed methodical observations of the night sky. However, the invention of the telescope was required before astronomy was able to develop into a modern science. Historically, astronomy has included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational astronomy and the making of calendars, but professional astronomy is nowadays often considered to be synonymous with astrophysics.[2]\r\n\r\nDuring the 20th century, the field of professional astronomy split into observational and theoretical branches. Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects, which is then analyzed using basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. The two fields complement each other, with theoretical astronomy seeking to explain the observational results and observations being used to confirm theoretical results.\r\n\r\nAstronomy is one of the few sciences where amateurs can still play an active role, especially in the discovery and observation of transient phenomena and Amateur astronomers have made and contributed to many important astronomical discoveries.','0','0','0','No','Rejected','No','No','2014-09-17 17:24:40'),(580,'Maitraiyee Tiwari','1992-10-01','Female','Indian','maitraiyee.tiwari@gmail.com','45, Patrakar Colony , Link road no.3, Bhopal','462003','Bho','Madhya Pradesh','0755 2767543','Room no. 56, Girls Hostel, IIT Hyderabad, Ordanance Factory campus, Yeddumailaram,\r\n Telangana','502205','Hyderabad','Andhra Pradesh','General','Xth Std','St. Josephs Convent School','CBSE',2008,'',93,'XIIth Std','St. Josephs Convent School','CBSE',2010,'',89,'B.Sc.','St. Stephens College','Delhi University',2013,'',84,'M.Sc.','Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad','',2014,'',85,'B.Sc.

Subsequently, I had the chance to participate in some research projects during the time of my bachelors and masters degree which enhanced my interest in astrophysics even more. \r\nDuring my summer project with Dr. Siddhartha Malu at Indian Institute of Technology, Indore , i got exposed to a lot of research papers and some books like Principles of Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics by C.J. Clarke and R.F. Carswell. Through these i learnt how equations of Hydrodynamics can be used directly to understand the dynamics of stars in galaxies, clusters of galaxies, their mergers leading to shocks. One of the things which intrigues me a lot is how the X- Ray emissions from the galaxy clusters can help in deriving the gravitational potential and hence the amount and distribution of the dark matter, the radio emissions which reveal the presence of ultra relativistic particles and magnetic fields through the detection of giant synchrotron radio halos and radio relics.\r\nTill  now i have never had any first hand experience in observational astronomy, but i have always enjoyed doing laboratory experiments.

Here we tried to calculate the rate of accretion of dark matter onto the super massive black holes at the center of galaxies.\r\nCalculation was made by considering Boltzman distribution function while determining the number of dark matter particles entering the event horizon of the black hole. Another assumption was made by taking the density of dark matter inversely proportional to the distance of the particle from where it started to the centre of the super massive black hole. \r\nThe rate of accretion came out to be large. I am now trying to use it to explain the unusually large growth rate of supermassive black holes of galaxies NGC 4342 and NGC 4291 (latest Chndra Studies).    ','1.

What fascinates me most is that in astronomy, the universe is our laboratory, and by studying the cosmos beyond our own planet, we can understand how physics works under extreme conditions which are impossible to create on earth. Astrophysics, on the other hand, deals with the study of the nature of the heavenly bodies, rather than their positions or motions in space. It strike me as one of the most exciting areas of research today. Thanks to new precise observations, better computational methods and more powerful simulations, we can now hope to answer some of the most profound questions ever raised. \r\n\r\nI am interested in theoretical astrophysics pertaining to classical and quantum aspects of general relativity, the physics of strongly gravitating objects such as black holes and cosmology. In particular, I am extremely interested in the new perspective: \"gravity as an emergent phenomenon\", put forward by Prof. T. Padmanabhan. He suggested that field equations of general relativity have the same status as those in emergent phenomena like elasticity or fluid mechanics where equations of motion are valid at length scales much larger than the typical inter-particle separations. Fluids or gases exhibit thermal phenomena which can only be explained by considering random motion of discrete microscopic constituents. The fact that thermodynamic properties such as temperature and entropy can also be associated with horizons found in Einsteins gravity and that one could imagine space-time as an emergent phenomenon, valid at scales large compared to some typical \r\nlength scales, is quite remarkable indeed. \r\n\r\nTo obtain a quantum theory of gravity is the most challenging problem in modern theoretical physics. String theory, widely considered as the most viable approach for a quantum theory of gravity, is a \"bottom-up\" approach from quantization of gravity to establish the general theory of relativity. The idea of treating gravity as an emergent phenomenon also has deep implications for quantum gravity. It is a \"top-down\" approach from classical theories of gravity to establish micro-structure of space-time as opposed to \"bottom-up\" attempts to quantize gravity. The goal then becomes to discover the nature of the underlying true degrees of freedom and then to develop a quantum theory for these degrees of freedom. I have read several popular and non-technical articles written by Prof. Padmanabhan on this topic and have found them all to be \r\nexceedingly intriguing.\r\n\r\nGiven an opportunity, I would be very interested in joining IUCAA or NCRA for my Ph.D. Program.

This could not be explained well and thus correlated with a super natural power.\r\nIn India, thousand years ago saints and priests started their work in astronomy. They studied the motion of planets, sun, comets, asteroid etc. and observed how they affect the earth and human life. They found out the cause of astronomical events. But they did not compile their research and knowledge in the form of a single book. At that time science was at its peak. After closing their chapters man again came to the bottom.\r\nThe great minds, Aryabhatta, Copernecous and Galileo came forward and proposed their theories to explain about the truth of astronomical events; however, they faced the criticism and anger of society.\r\nThis is all about my understanding of astronomy and its origin. Most of the part of the universe is still uncovered, which is why I am fascinated and motivated to explore it.\r\nMy view for astronomy and astrophysics                      \r\nAccording to T. S. Eliot, In my beginning is my end. I think that our all movement is connected with universe. If we know about the origin of the universe, we will find much about our past and future. It means somewhere our mind contains a lot of knowledge about universe. It is only needed to extract it. When I see in the dark sky, I think if the entire universe born from a point (Big-Bang), then where was that point contained before. It may be possible that not a single point was there but many other points form different universe. If earth contains us, and solar system contains earth, galaxies contains number of solar systems and universe contains number of galaxies, then how is it not possible to have a space in which number of universe are contained? Our forefathers discovered the planets without any instruments and they calculated their distances from sun and time of occurrence of many astronomical events. How did they do that? Now we have advanced technology, bigger telescopes and advanced observatories. Its time to know about us. If some day we know about us then that day we will meet the real truth of universe.\r\nThe great scientist Albert Einstein said that I believe in GOD because there is only power of God in all mysteries of universe.\r\nIf all astronomical objects were fixed in their path, then how could we change our future? A thought came in my mind that my birth would not be futile. Given a chance, I shall contribute my best to uncover the mysteries of universe and to help mankind.\r\nThanking you.\r\n','I have worked on organic light emitting field effect transistors (OLEFETs). OLEFETs are based on organic semiconductors where it is possible to achieve the supramolecular organization leading to both charge carrier transport and electroluminescence. OLEFETs are multifunctional devices that combine the current modulating function of a transistor with light emission. They are attractive for both fundamental studies and technological applications. OLEFETs are excellent test systems to investigate physical processes such as charge carrier injection, transport, and electroluminescence (EL) in organic semiconductors. The planar geometry of the device (compared to the vertically stacked geometry of organic LEDs, OLEDs), offers direct access to optical probes to image electroluminescence.

She said, when there are possibilities of raining then Moon itself make that ring. But I could not find satisfaction in her answer. Still I am trying to find why that ring forms? Another thing is that during evening nearly at 7 to 7:30 pm, when I observe the sky I see some moving small lights in the sky, when tried to find what was that, then I found that the moving lights are nothing but the artificial satellites.

As a kid i used to wonder how the and sun and the stars produce such immense amount of energy through Nuclear Fusion. I also wondered how gravity attract bodies to each other according to einsteins General Relativity.I also wondered about how the stars form from a gaseous nebula and also about how they die.I have came to know that stars have three stages of death which are white dwarf,neutron stars or pulser(rotating neutron star),black hole.I also wondered what is beyond the event horizon of black hole.I also want to know about how the space time continuum could be warped as proposed for IXS Enterprise.I also wondered how in a particle accelerator like LHC(Large Hadron Collider)  antimatter is obtained by smashing regular matter(proton) and also about other particles like bosons,fermions,leptons and also about the Standard Model Of The Universe.I also want to know about CMB(Common Microwave Background),and trace it back towards the Big Bang and the hot massive state(Quark gluon plasma) after it.I also want to know whether the universe will go on expanding to infinity or would it collapse back to a single point which may lead to a Big Bang and repeat this all again.As i was very interested in knowing all these topics,i have searched youtube and wikipedia about them but i find the math very difficult as the calculus used is very advance for me.I am inspired by Stephen Hawking the world renound astrophysicist and also by Neil Degrasse Tyson the host of the TV series COSMOS.As i joined mechanical engineering i wanted to know about the working of various engines such as reciprocating engine,wankel engine,stirling engine,turbojet engine,pulsejet engine,ramjet engine,scramjet engine and rocket engine and i realised that future travels could not be made possible using these engines as more efficient and faster engines would become necessary to travel across planets or galaxies at speed greater than that of light as proposed for the IXS enterprise by NASA.I want to know all these because this is my passion and i am very much excited in knowing the secrets of nature and also it kind of make me feel special.And i am certain that more men have to focus on to these areas of astrophysics as a lot is there to be learned and found in space.     ','I have learned some of the above said topics from youtube and wikipedia.Also from a TV series the COSMOS\r\nwhich also inspired me to take up space science.I did a technical article in the collage magazine MECHAZINE about How A Helicopter Work.I am preparing to do a project to make a miniature scale jet engine using a turbocharger as the compressor and turbine.I have also attented a model aircraft designing and building class conducted by aerotrix in start up village kochi.

As we know, Dr. JayantNaralikar who is the one of founder of this institution, his work in this field and his name inspired me to read about this. The galaxies, the black holes, the stars, pulsars, supernovas,...all those have made brain storming for me. The giant radio telescopes who look beyond the sky ,they have made me to think that \"Can there be another living system than earth in this universe??\"  The death  of star which finally ends into a black hole. The black hole is most curious thing in this universe. It does not emit light ,it absorbs light, stars present nearby it..Dr.StepherdHawkings had done research on this. The minute radio waves which are found all over the universe .itsinteresting to deal with them.,to analyse them and to draw some conclusion from that analysis. The light is only most curious thing I found. The various  types of waves from electromagnetic spectrum ,they are found in this abundant universe. I like to work upon them. I know  whatever I have written here is much less knowledge about this ..But those things made me curious and are my field of interest. This subject is that much vast as the universe is. As this universe is expanding, the research is also that much toughand complicated.\r\n       As we know, this field is not that much known to people alike other fields. So I did not get proper guidance to go in this field at right time.\r\n      I haven?t got contact with this subject during my engineering.

I am a regular reader of astronomy magazines and books like Discovering the Universe by William J. Kaufmann. I have some basic knowledge on handling and using a telescope for star gazing purposes. I got attracted even more towards this exciting field when I started a self-study on the celestial behavior occurring in the sky.\r\n\r\nI have great vigor and zeal in the above mentioned field. I aspire to gain more knowledge regarding Galaxy Morphology, Accretion disks, Stars characterization, Stars formation, Solar System, especially Stellar Spectroscopy and X-ray astronomy. Starting with a vacant mind on astronomy, I wanted to have an overall touch on all branches of astrophysics. To begin with, I chose solar physics (the most fundamental one). I had many times seen some clear dark patches on the solar surface as well as on the moon. But the moons patches were quite common to us and no one talked about the sun. So I chose my first project to do on these dark patches which are called sunspots. It was named as multi wavelength observations of sunspots which dealt with the solar plasma flow behavior in the various solar regions and the Doppler shift in those regions. Coming to now,  in the intra-galactic context, I would like to make a deep  study  on neutrinos from the sun and on oscillations of the sunspots and the magnetic field intensity ( provided by HMI data)  in the umbra and penumbra in the  various solar regions starting from photosphere to corona . I also desire to work on the swalloping of the Milky Way galaxy and study the existence of the same in other galaxies if pulsation and macro-turbulence. Being a good programmer, I am quite sure that I will be able to handle the computational work related to these very well. This would provide me a platform to enhance my basic knowledge on properties of stars on which astronomers base their models of stellar evolution, chemical composition, plotting of astronomical data analysis, related instrument, image processing as well as multiple phase structure.

As I grew up I wanted to know all about what those pictures meant.I am still learning. Perhaps i like astronomy because we are personally a way of the Universe experiencing itself,or that we are all made of star-stuff,as Carl Sagan so elegantly put it. Astronomy is a science that seeks to explain everything that we observe in the Universe,from the comets and planets in our own solar system to distant galaxies to the echoes of the Big Bang. By studying the cosmos beyond our own planet,we can understand where we came from,where we are going,why is the universe organized as it is?Are we alone? And how physics works under conditions which are impossible to recreate on Earth. In astronomy,the Universe is our laboratory!

For the Solar Tornadoes project, I am taking time slice diagram measurements for two tornado-like prominences. For my thesis, I am further analyzing the effects of the magnetic field variations in the region of the filament to find causes for eruptions and also if it has any effect on the mass motion into and out of the filaments. ','Yes',NULL,'Theory, Observations, Computation','An interest in astronomy and astrophysics was triggered in school when studying about working of stars. Fascinated, I went through the limited number of books on the subject at the school library. Choosing IT and further taking a professional job in the IT industry lead me away from my interests. However, during the time of my job in Bangalore, I was introduced to the Bangalore Astronomy Society, a local group of likeminded individuals interested in the various aspects of Astronomy. The night-time observation trips and the interactions with the people in the group pulled me back and further deep into the field. Having a reduced interest in the Software field, I decided to pursue the master?s program in Space Studies at the University of North Dakota, USA that facilitated my involvement in Astronomy and Astrophysics academically. As part of the program, I took Observational Astronomy, Orbital Mechanics, Astrophysics and Sun and the Space Environment courses. I also chose to do my thesis on the features on the Chromospehre of the Sun. I was fortunate to get internship opportunities at places like the CfA and Helio Research also to do solar research. At CfA, I got an insight into the daily activities of the Solar and Astrophysics scientists, about how they work with real live satellites and the data obtained from them. My project guide at CfA is an established professor and from him, I learnt the procedure of developing models of the chromosphere and the physical processes involved. At Helio Research, I learnt a lot about observational details of the Sun, how to \"see\" features on the Sun and also how to be sceptical about different analyses and conclusions about various theories and observations. To this end, Sara (Martin) has been a great teacher and I will always revere working with her. I worked on the apparent solar tornado prominences at Helio Research with Sara, where we used the method of time-slice diagrams to see if the rotational motion in the tornado like prominences is real. My thesis research involved analysis of the mass motion into and out of solar filaments and magnetic properties of the end points of the filaments. The research done during the processes of the various projects intrigued me more and more into learning about what the reasons could be for the behaviour of the filaments, eruptions, flares and coronal loops on the Sun. I also had the opportunity of attending several conferences during my tenure as a master?s student. The most influential and striking conference was the SPD (Solar Physics Division Conference) 2014. The presence and presentations of the solar physicists at the conference and the interactions with them inspired me hugely to stay put in the field. Science has always been a part of life, thanks to my mother; but it is more so now. And various factors apart from the reward-factor in my own brain are responsible for keeping my interest growing in science, astronomy and astrophysics.','As part of thesis during the masters course, I did an elaborate observational analysis of three filaments in an active region. Mass motion into and \r\n\r\nout of the filaments to the chromosphere was studied as a possible mechanism for filaments to acquire mass. Magnetic properties of the ends of the filaments \r\n\r\nwere also studied. \r\nTwo sets of data containing apparent tornado like prominences were used for disproving rotation in the prominences using time-slice diagrams. Both the above \r\nprojects used high definition small FOV data sets. The filaments projects used data from the Dutch Open Telescope (resolution of 0.11\") and the tornadoes data were obtained from Helio Research which has a resolution of 0.9\". \r\nAt CfA, I was involved in the observational analysis of EVE spectra of the Sun at the time of flares. The analysis was used as input for the PANDORA program to model the chromosphere during solar flares.','During my masters, I was awarded Graduate Research Assistantships through out the course except in the final semester. I was also given internship opportunities at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophsycis and Helio Research organisations. ','Not taken in the recent years.

But what gathered my attention was Black Hole. I hardly got anything at that time but even then I found some of its characteristics very interesting. Then I began studying the basics of astrophysics and the eventually my interest became more strong. During the second year of my B.Sc. I wrote an article on Olbers Paradox for the Physics Journal of our college. I get completely driven off whenever I gaze at the Celestial Sphere. Now that I have taken Astronomy and Astrophysics as one of my specialization, there are so many amazing and beautiful features that has gathered my attention and I am sure there are many more to come. One of the interesting feature of our Solar System is that the outer planets are giant and gaseous. The reason is also well defined that when our Sun was young, it blew gases into the outer fringe of the solar system. But recent researches have shown that there do exist extrasolar system where gas giants are orbiting closer to their Sun. So, I think that the structure of Solar System and similar extrasolar systems might depend on the composition of the solar dust and also on the density variation of the protoplanetary disk once when the accretion process of a protostar terminates and also on the mass and the magnetic field of the protostar. This is more or less analogous to the atomic structure, where the nuclear charge and mass determines the energy gap between the electron orbits. One other interesting thing that I have recently read about is Outer components in our Solar System has their angular momentum much greater than what is expected due to their large distance from our Sun. Similarly the outer components of our Galaxy are also revolving faster than expected. This concept has been explained by using the term Halo, which is considered to be an outer cover of our galaxy. The concept of Halo has been least understood. And I would like to read and study more about Halo. The expanding universe is also a very interesting and mind grabbing feature of the universe. The expansion of Universe should have slowed down due to the gravitational pull between the massive bodies. But what has been observed is that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating, which I think is an evidence of anti gravity. But anything like anti gravity has not been realised yet. So, I would also like to know about dark energy and dark matter. At my personal level I have got a telescope (Newtonian Reflector, 130mm) along with one of my friend and have watched few planets and moon. Though deep sky observation is possible through this telescope, but due to the air and light pollution of Delhi I have not yet done a deep sky observation.','I got selected for Summer Program in Experimental Physics, TIFR in the year 2012.

I fondly remember my father showing me a wispy swath of white across the night sky; the Milky Way.\r\nThe very fact that I chose to do a B.Tech in Physical Sciences (Astronomy) bears testimony. A small telescope I made in my junior year gave me immense joy. A solar physics workshop in my final year was one of my better learning experiences. I am tremendously grateful that I had professors and mentors who taught me well in college, always motivating and pushing me to do better, to think on my feet and to be amazed at the littler things.\r\nI was lucky enough to have done an internship and a project at IUCAA, a fine temple of learning as far as astronomy and astrophysics is concerned. Everything seemed intellectually challenging, beautifully so, be it the modelling, or the simulations, or the theory. \r\nThe project in particular, enabled me to study the basics of Einsteins General Relativity, something of a boyhood desire; if only my younger self could see me now. There was also a thoroughly enjoyable cosmology lecture series I attended during my time there.\r\nI am thankful for having had the opportunity to interact and work with some of the formost individuals in the field.\r\nI would consider wanting to do research in this field as a culmination of all that I have learnt and of all that I ever wished to study. \r\nThis is my calling.','As given in field 15b,\r\nI did a month-long internship at IUCAA, Pune, under Dr.A.N.Ramaprakash. The study dealt with a thorough understanding of the polarization phenomenon, and culminated in an analysis and comparison of certain averaging techniques commonly employed in measuring the same. \r\nI also carried out my final semester B.Tech project at IUCAA, Pune, this time on Gravitational Waves, working with Dr.Tarun Souradeep and Dr.Sanjit Mitra. The project involved a fundamental study of General Relativity, and culminated in some basic data analysis with the Matched Filtering technique.\r\nI had also done a short-term project at IISER, Trivandrum, working with Dr.Archana Pai, on the analysis of Gravitational Chirps and Parameter Estimation.','Was chosen for a summer-programme at Goddard Space Flight Centre, NASA, Maryland, USA, as a part of the IIST-USRA undergraduate student summer research programme.\r\nWas the topper in the Astronomy Stream at IIST.\r\nWas a steady general proficiency winner, and an enthusiastic participant in the science and mathematics olympiads and a keen quizzer when in school.\r\n','General GRE - 323\r\nPhysics GRE - 96 percentile','No','Selected','No','No','2014-09-18 16:50:15'),(646,'tata sanjay kanna sharma','1992-05-07','Male','INDIAN','kannasri00@gmail.com','18-3-33 kadhi colony','517507','Tirupati','Andhra Pradesh','919966395015','DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS\r\nSRI VENKATESWARA UNIVERSITY\r\nTIRUPATHI','517507','Tirupati','Andhra Pradesh','General','Xth Std','JAGANMATHA ENGLISH MEDIUM HIGH SCHOOL','A.P STATE BOARD ',2007,'A',81,'XIIth Std','SRI CHAITHNYA JUNIOR COLLEGE','A.P STATE BOARD',2009,'A',70,'Int.

The band gap energy of the Ni doped samples found to decrease with increasing its concentrations. Room-temperature photoluminescence spectra of the undoped CdS nanoparticles showed strong near band emission centered at 530 nm and a weak red emission shoulder positioned at 660 nm. With the doping of the Ni2+, the green emission peak was shifted to longer wavelength 545 nm, but the position of weak red emission shoulder was unaltered with doping. In addition, it was found that the overall photoluminescence intensity was decreased as the Ni2+ doping.','*Won SWAMI VIVEKAKNANDA SEVA MEDAL from swami Vivekananda seva samithi, mylapore in the year 2013.\r\n*Stood 1st in ROBO WAR/ROBO SOCCER at IIT HYDERABAD 2013.\r\n*Won 1st prize for future ideas in communication from vellore institute of technology in the year 2012.\r\n*Won 1st prize in poster presentation at Sastra University in HAPTIC TECHNOLOGY in the year 2012.\r\n*Won 1st prize in poster presentation at ALL INDIA SCIENCE FARE EXPO for NANOTECHNOLOGY in the year 2012.\r\n*won SAHITHI AWARD in WORLD TELUGU CONFERENCE in the year 2012.','','Yes','Waiting','No','No','2014-09-19 00:52:21'),(617,'Priyanka Kale','1993-09-16','Female','Indian','sachinargade111@gmail.com','A/p-Nimone,Pimplachi Wadi,Tal-Shirur,Dist-Pune ','412210','Pune','Maharashtra','91-9860455396','SP College,Lokamanya Nagar,Sadashiv Peth,Pune 411030\r\n','411030','Pune','Maharashtra','General','Xth Std','Pravara Kanya Vidya Mandir,Pravarangar,Loni(kd),Tal-Rhata','Maharashtra',2009,'Dest',76,'XIIth Std','Pravara Kanya Vidya Mandir,Pravaranagar','Maharashtra',2011,'First ',64,'B.Sc.','SP college,Pune','Pune ',2014,'First',61,'NULL','','',0,'',0,'B.sc Phy','2014','Prof.Wagholikar Sir.','Sachin Argade','','No',NULL,'Theory, Observations, Computation','I would like to know about astronomy in details and also interested to do research on astronomy and astrophysics.

With a longing to be a part of astronomy community and an amateur interest I am highly motivated to carve out a full fledged career in astronomy and astrophysics I am single mindedly focused to attain my goal and hence see a higher degree with research as an enabler for its fulfillment.\r\n \r\nAstronomy and astrophysics is among the most profound of all the sciences. And grasping such a specialized field requires apt guidance in addition to in depth technical know-how.\r\nConcerning India, IUCAA undoubtedly stands firm in the history of Indian astronomy peering into the realms of unchartered. And with the right mix of students and mentors it provides the best opportunity for growth and development.\r\n\r\nHaving come from an instrumentation background I intend to hone my skills and pick up the nuances of astronomical instrumentation for a flourishing carrier in observational cosmology. Complex questions at the interface of science and philosophy are a routine in cosmology and that makes it one of the most interesting as well as challenging fields of science. Therefore surveying the unexplored deep realms of space seems to be the ultimate personification of human curiosity.\r\nAt this juncture cosmology is in a state where it has evolved from a speculative theory into a structured science. It is a young field which is growing at a fast pace, thus it provides an exciting journey to the seeker. As challenging as it seems so is the scope of development. Considering large scale structures and their formation, cosmic microwave background studies, high energy astrophysics, and several other exotic questions being dealt gives this field an immense potential.\r\nHaving come vis-a-vis with practical aspects in the field of electronics and instrumentation during Errection, Commissioning and Startup activities of DHDT unit EOL, and later the Maintenance activities involved with the DCU unit EOL, I feel all the more motivated to apply this knowledge in the field of astronomy and attempt to address the pressing questions of today and the concerns of tommorrow. As this field demands precision and accuracy of the highest levels and loosening of bottlenecks in observation, the work in observational astrophysics is critical for its growth, which I aspire to make a career out of.\r\n \r\nHence lastly I would say a challenging field of study and a nurturing environment is all a curious mind can ask for. With a knack to question set beliefs and seeking an answer to majority of doubts, I see astronomy and astrophysics as the most rewarding journey for me. I enjoy the learning experience, the sense of wonder, the sense of accomplishment and the camaraderie astronomy shares with one and all and thus seek to join this colossal quest.\r\n',' B. Tech Project titled ?Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting in Shoes? in Nov 2010. -With ubiquitous advances being made in wireless technology and low power electronics, the need for autonomous power supplies has caused the amount of research into power harvesting devices to become progressively larger over the last decade. Though the piezoelectric energy can be harvested but still a commercialized product is elusive due to several factors such as scarce resources, low output etc. In this spirit the project analyzes the piezoelectric energy harvesting system, and strives to put forth alternative options for further amendments, with greater emphasis on the modulating circuit used. . \"Optimized piezoelectric energy harvesting through a modulating circuit.\" Aman Sharma, Jaydeep Parmar.

It?s just a question ? why it is as it and why it exists at all. ?  \r\nFor me also the whole Universe is a big question mark?  It is a big mystery. I want to solve the mysteries of  the Universe and want to explore the Unknown and see the Unseen.  I am interested in infinite secrets which have been a big question for human beings.  Astronomy is such a vast ocean of mysteries and I want to unfold and dive in to it. As a student, this subject has always raised so many questions in my mind which I want to solve and study deeply. In every particle of the Universe, we feel the presence of Almighty.  I feel the strong connection between the theory of Big Bang and God Particle.\r\n According to Max Plank, ?The person who does not ask the questions, he is not getting the physics truly?\r\n My mind is full of so many questions whose answers, I want to seek through Astronomy.  Moreover, it contains question asking ?Why? and I want to know the reply of every secret related to The Universe.  For many years, people were under the impression that the earth is the centre of the Universe and Galileo, Copernicus and Kepler  removed this ignorance by their theories.  What we know presently might be far off from reality of The Universe. Presently, the Voyager space ship, which has already crossed the limit of our Solar System, continuously gives the information of the outer world. I want to know and study all these facts very deeply. \r\nSecondly, the theories of Minkowski and Einstein, specially, the theory of relativity appeals to me.

Abstract:\r\nA novel MEMS displacement sensor based on racetrack ring resonator is proposed and studied in this paper. The sensor is basically structured on a micro-cantilever beam, and add and drop racetrack ring resonator is integrated on the supporting end of the beam to gain maximum stress and linearly varying longitudinal strain. Thus, when force is applied, the beam will bend, that induces a stress and strain, which brings a change in refractive index and perimeter of the rings leading to change in the output spectrum shift providing the measure of displacement. It is also observed that there is a good linear relationship between wavelength shift and displacement. Sensitivity as high as 2.943 nm/m has been achieved and it is capable of measuring within range of (0-11.65)m.','N/A','N/A','No','Selected','No','No','2014-09-18 21:46:11'),(635,'Sandip','1985-04-03','Male','Indian','sandip.patil@bharatforge.com','Kalyani Center for Technology and Innovation (KCTI) \r\nSurvey No.15\r\nAhead of Renuka Mata Mandir, Keshavnagar, Pune','411036','Pune','Maharashtra','02067271923','Kalyani Center for Technology and Innovation (KCTI) \r\nSurvey No.15\r\nAhead of Renuka Mata Mandir, Keshavnagar, Pune','411036','Pune','Maharashtra','General','Xth Std','Mahatma Gandhi Vidyalay Ashta','Kolhapur',2000,'DIST',77,'XIIth Std','Mahatma Gandhi Junior College Ashta','Kolhapur',2002,'DIST',83,'B.E.','PVPIT Budhgaon Sangli','Shivaji',2007,'DIST',71,'M.Tech.','Indian Institute of Technology Bombay','IIT Powai',2012,'AA',90,'M.Tech (Materials, Manufacturing and Modelling Science)','2012','Dr.Suhas S Joshi, Ph.D\r\nRahul Bajaj Chair Professor,\r\nDepartment of Mechanical Engineering,\r\nIndian Institute of Technology, Bombay\r\n\r\n','Dr.Raju Kadam, Ph.D\r\nResearch Scientist/ Dy.

I do not remember how many times I read that chapter it might be fifty or above. After few days I watched the movie \"koi mil gaya\" which influenced me a lot.

It sounds strange, theoretically we can imagine this but but is it experimentally true? Also I came to know about the change in shape of the body and redshift at the  event horizon why this happens?? There are a lot of questions about black holes  which are the most mysterious objects in the universe which are formed when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. They are very dense objects so that gravity becomes very high and even light cannot escape from it which is a classical consequence.

We gaze at the endless sky and various questions agitate our curiosity-Will the universe continue to expand? Does life exist somewhere else too? Throughout the passing ages, astronomers have been working incessantly to satisfy the curiosities about the universe.As I grew up, this science ha somehow touched me and captured my attention and imagination. Hence, I would love to delve deeper into it and work ceaselessly to unfold the mysteries of the universe.Astronomy simply speaking, is the study of objects and matter outside the earth atmosphere and of the physical and chemical properties. Throughout history , the human race has looked to the infinite sky to navigate the vast oceans,to decide when to plant crops, to make calenders. early civilizations and prehistoric cultures like the Egyptians and the Chinese gave a great deal of importance to astronomy. The annual flooding in Nile, the alignment of the pyramids in Egypt to the pole star, the charting of the regular events happening in the sky and development of an extensive system of the zodiac to guide the life of people, are some of these cultures few use of astronomy. Its one of the sciences where amateurs have played an active role and contributed many discoveries.The planet Earth seems to be a speck in the whole universe. As i grew up, my views of the world became even more entwined with the stars. I had come to know the basics of this science. Certain awe inspiring facts like, the elements that our bodies are made up of are the same as that we find in stars, gas and the dust around them, seem to motivate me to explore this field.My interest peaked up when I recently attended the summer school on Astronomy and Astrophysics. It introduced me to a whole new dimension. We were taught many new ideas about stars, their formation and death, pulsars, neutron stars, supernova explosions. The idea of seeing two suns in the sky during a supernova still fascinates me. Dynamo theory is one of my topic of interest. I would like to understand better the origin of the magnetic field of the sun which is responsible for most of the solar magnetic phenomena. Its very interesting to note that the sun being a much known planet, still has so many unsolved queries. The teachers also shared their experiences of working with the large telescopes. Radio Astronomy is also another topic of my interest.

She was a hero for the people of the nation, being from a very humble background she had achieved the heights which no one ever did in the country. She was an inspiration but even more inspiring was the fact that what made her to go into space, what is exactly out there.

I became familiar with the latest research in the field of astrophysics and read about works of Stephen Hawking. The most captivating part of Hawking\"s work was the Hawking radiation and the information paradox, resolution of information paradox can prove to be the key to quantum gravity. I read as much as i could about it. I had decided to pursue a research career in theoretical astrophysics and quantum mechanics.

','No',NULL,'Observations','I am interested in Astronomy as it is the most advance field of science or we can say branch of physics that deals with studies of celestial body and the universe as a whole, thus it has a broad dimension of research. Astronomy is the oldest science. From the ancient age, beauty and vastness of open sky continue mankind to wonder. Here we explore from the basics- from solar system to galaxy, i.e., from star formation to evolution of universe. \r\n       Astronomy is basically originated from Greek word i.e., \"astron\" = star and \"nomos\" = arrangement, order or law. Astronomy, therefore, is the study of arrangement of stars, planet and space. The Big Bang theory given by astronomy explains not only the beginning of our own universe, space, matter and time, but also generation of all masses.\r\n       Unlike chemistry,physics or biology, astronomy is not a hands on science-astronomers cant experiment on the objects they study. But space probes sent to other worlds have changed this a little. Todays technology, however improved the process of observing stars and galaxies enormously. Astronomers can now tune into everything from radio waves to gamma rays-which all reveal what is going on in the cosmos. Electronics and computers have also revolutionized the collection of data and its analysis, meaning that astronomers have at their fingerprints more information about the universe than ever before.  \r\n              Being an electronics and telecommunication student, electronics has a major role in my branch. Similarly telecom is also my part of study and in astronomy we set a link between earth and satellites &amp; space and importance of electronics component in setting up this link is equal to the importance of communication devices. For eg. Electronic instruments with digital imaging devices have replaced old photography surveys etc.,similarly many communication and navigation satellites are there which occupy different orbits.\r\nThus other interesting part of astronomy is \"astrophysics\" which  involves the study of  physics of astronomy and concentrates on the behaviour, properties, and motion of objects out there and the two terms are often used interchangeably today. Modern astronomers tend to fall into two fields: the theoretical and the observational. Observational astronomers in the observational field focus on direct study of stars, planets, galaxies, and so forth. Theoretical astronomers model and analyze how systems may have evolved. Astrophysics (from Greek where -astron= \"star\" and physics= \"nature\") is the branch of astronomy that deals with the physics of the universe, especially with \"the nature of the heavenly bodies, rather than their positions or motions in space\". Among the objects studied are galaxies, stars, planets, extra solar planets, the interstellar medium and the cosmic  background. Because astrophysics is a very broad subject it has many disciplines of physics.So, generally astronomers are also called astrophysicists.Thus being a science and ET&amp;T student astronomy attracts me.

WHY CANT THAT? WHAT IS THAT CONSIST OF? BUT MY KNOWLEGDE IS LIMITED TO ANSWER TO THOSE QUESTIONS. IF I COULD CONTINUE MY CAREER ON ASTROPHYSICS IT WOULD BE BETTER AND INTERESTING OPPURTUNITY FOR ME TO PURSUE KNOWLEGDE IN THESE AREAS. IN THE FUTURE, I WOULD LIKE TO CARRY OUT RESEARCH IN THIS FIELD AND POSSIBLY USE MY SKILLS TO DISSEMINATE MY FAIR SHARE OF KNOWLEGDE TO OHTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',' AS A PART OF MY B.Sc.

That was first step for me in astronomical or space science related world. Further with reading of many encyclopedias, my curiosity and interest inclined more towards this field. Like every human I too asked questions about what exactly space is, (if indeed its true) then why exactly did God create us, what exactly black holes are, what physics does universe follow etc. Finding these answers eventually led me to be a physics person rather than just a normal person. So I started to attend events like one held by Astronomica club. I saw Saturn with telescope and its rings amazed me. Also they showed moon from telescope and for first time I saw the large craters on it clearly. But living in a small town such opportunities were quite a few. I did make small &amp; crude model of telescope for science exhibition. How it enables us to gaze into universe was unbelievable.\r\nStudying for JEE did enhance my knowledge in general physics. Works of Newton, Keplar, Einstein inspired me. The way Einstein theorized that space time is bendable, lights speed is absolute is just phenomenal. Maxwells electromagnetism, Heisenbergs uncertainty principle inspires me. \r\nI attended the program at GMRT on Science Day where I interacted with astrophysicists. I saw what work they conducted, learnt about pulsars, and studied the radio telescope through physics as well as engineering approach.\r\nRecently I heard about String theory and was drawn towards it. I could not comprehend the fact about there being 11 dimensions. So I searched about it. Also, the most powerful machine on the planet, Large Hadron Collider, is an engineering feat. I, as an engineer was naturally interested. I too want to apply my engineering knowledge in astronomy.\r\nQuantum Mechanics is so one of confusing branch and draws attention. An electron at two places simultaneously and this fact can be used to make fastest supercomputer ever is just mind boggling. And how being so far from every star we know and yet we can detect precise information about it like size, composition etc. leads to Physics and Engineering hand in hand. \r\nI disagree with certain ideas put forth by scientists and hence want to study them in detail. Astrophysics study will help me to find answers to my question and verify my theories. I want to contribute to science and develop our knowledge regarding the Universe. Knowing how everything works at the most fundamental level has always been passion. It helps from engineering perspective too for detecting problems and resolving them.\r\nI want to help our nation to develop in Astronomy. We have shown potential with PLSV, Mangalyaan. We have so much to unlock and I would love to be a part of it.\r\n','I have carried out project on Hydroelectricity at school level which got selected for District Level. It was miniature working model.\r\nI have carried out research on Solar Heliostat in T.E.

How the universe began? Is there any beginning? Can we travel in time? What are dimensions? And the answer to all these emerges from science. I came across these questions when I was studying for IIT-JEE. So I am very eager to study science (astronomy in particular) in detail to find answers.\r\n I am really inspired by work of Galileo who invented the first telescope and saw the universe to what it actually is! Newton gave the laws of motion, and very famous law of gravitation, Keplar gave laws of planetary motion and they are still in use after about 300 to 400 years.  What an observation have they done!\r\nThe discovery of electricity, electromagnetic induction forces the scientists to think at micro level and discovery of electron by Thompson introduces us with fundamental particle. And thus world of modern physics began. Then scientists found number of other fundamental particles which are not visible but their existence can be sensed like quarks.\r\nThe work of Max Planck, Maxwell about electromagnetism has also inspired me.  Einstein has greatly influenced me because of his work, and for the fact that he has had a mathematical background and then he studied physics and challenged the basic concepts of physics and by considering the speed of light as constant gave birth to The General Theory of Relativity. He gave revolutionary idea of space time curvature. Even lot of criticized theory gets proved finally.\r\nQuantum mechanics is the new branch of science and studies the world at microscopic level in which anything can happen such as disappearing of particle from one place and can appear at another place. I want to study all this strangeness and eccentricity of universe.\r\nBrief history of time by Stephen hawking also inspired me to study astronomy. Discovery channel programs about space and time, through the wormhole, encourages me to do something in the field of astronomy. These programs also introduce me about the ongoing researches in astronomical world and keep me in update about latest discovery.  I have visited to GMRT and saw their working and gained information about pulsar. I want to see such astronomical phenomena and analyze them.\r\nPSLV, chandrayaan and mangalyaan projects have proven that our country is strong in astronomy. This inspires me to add my contribution in this field and help develop nation and science. I would like to work with ISRO in such projects. \r\nNow scientists are in search of the god particle which gives the property of mass to the substance and searching for truth about big bang on LHC. It is constructed on various concepts of physics but actually it is the marvel of engineering. And also all astronomical instruments are engineering creation, as an engineer I want to work on latest project in the world about astronomy. So I hope that study of astronomy will help me to do so.\r\n','I have done research work on Design of Piston Ring for reducing friction in modern IC engine.\r\nCurrently working on project called Kinetic Energy Recovery System(KERS).','Won Best Teacher Award on Teachers Day at college','','No','Rejected','No','No','2014-09-19 15:38:37'),(681,'seemavarpe','1990-10-04','Female','Indian','seema.varpe@gmail.com','A/P-Kalamb (Varpemala),\r\nTal-Ambegaon,\r\nDist-Pune,\r\n410515','410515','Kalamb','Maharashtra','9975250482','A/P-Kalamb (Varpemala),\r\nTal-Ambegaon,\r\nDist-Pune,\r\n410515','410515','Kalamb','Maharashtra','General','Xth Std','Kamalajadevi Vidyalay, Kalamb','Pune',2006,'A',82,'XIIth Std','Annasaheb Awate College ,Manchar','Pune',2008,'A',77,'B.Sc.','Annasaheb Awate College ,Manchar','Pune',2011,'A',85,'M.Sc.','Dept. of Physics,University of Pune','Pune',2013,'B',67,'M.Sc Physics','2013',' Dr. Y.D.Kolekar\r\nAssistant Professor at \r\nDept.of Physics\r\nUniversity of Pune ,Pune7','Dr.V.

An unbounded, bottomless ocean of knowledge is how I see it.\r\n\r\nOver the years, my interest in this field has changed from an initial curiosity to a definite passion. When I was introduced to the concept of planets and solar system in my school, I used to wonder that how they could move in such a fixed path, how they were formed and which planet came before. But I was too young to understand these things technically. This led me to read the stories in holy books which explain the origin of Universe, how it was formed and from where it came into its very existence.\r\n\r\nAs I grew older, I started understanding the technical aspects of this field, not much in detail but an overview. The Big Bang Theory was the one which drew my attention the most amongst all topics. I started reading magazines and tried to understand it. Gradually I realised my field of interest. So, I got the answer of the question that was asked to me frequently: \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\". The answer was \"Astronomer\".\r\n\r\nAfter my high school, I pursued my education in B.Tech Mechanical Engineering because I was also interested in mechanics and making devices. I was well aware that I will need knowledge of this field in making devices for future research. Though I took Mechanical Engineering, I did not stop my work on astronomy. When I read Special Theory of Relativity I became more passionate for research in Astronomy. I started working with my teachers and seniors on project.\r\n\r\nI made a detailed project, on \"Theory of Universe\", which was accepted as my semester project. This gave me more knowledge and confidence to work further. Next I spoke in my college?s seminar on the topic \"Theory of Universe -How far have we reached?\".\r\n\r\nAll this has motivated me to plan my career towards academics whereby I can continue to pursue my interest in research. With my goals well outlined and the commitment to my career, I am prepared to move on towards the long cherished dream of specializing in Astronomy and contribute to this ever advancing field.\r\n','I have worked on the theory of origin of universe and made a project on \"Theory of Universe\". In this project I have explained different proposed theories on origin of universe, their limitations and fields where still research has to be done. This project was accepted by my college as a semester project.\r\n Next, I spoke in my college seminar on \"Theory of Universe -How far have we reached?\".\r\n','I was district topper in CBSE 10th Board and was awarded by my school and newspaper \"Prabhat Khabar\" for that.\r\nI was school science topper in CBSE 12th Board and was awarded by my school for that.\r\nApart from this I have also got prizes in different co-curricular activities:-\r\nI have got 2nd position in balloon car competition in our college techfest.\r\nI have got 1st position in Counter-Strike competition in my college.  \r\n','','No','Rejected','No','No','2014-09-19 16:14:21'),(683,'priya asthana','1989-10-25','Female','indian','pcshukla26@gmail.com','Priya Asthana D/O P.C.Asthana C/O Dhananjay Deshmukh , 410 ,Rachna Nagar,Nera Chetak Bridge.','462023','Bhopal','Madhya Pradesh','9165817051','Ujjain Engineering College,indore road,Ujjain','456010','Ujjain','Madhya Pradesh','General','Xth Std','kendriya vidyalaya 3 eme centre bairagarh','cbse',2006,'',85,'XIIth Std','kendriya vidyalaya no 2 shivaji nagar bhopal','cbse',2008,'',75,'B.E.','ujjain engineering college,ujjain',' ujjain engineering co',2014,'',69,'NULL','N/A','N/A',0,'',0,'Bachelors of Engineering in Mechanical engineering','2014','Dr. Sunil Punjabi (associate professor,department of mechanical engineering,ujjain engineering college,ujjain),(minor project guide)','Prof. Manoj Gupta(associate professor,department of mechanical engineering,ujjain engineering college,ujjain),(major project guide)','my CGPA upto 6th semester was 6.9, SGPA of 7th semester was 7.33 and SGPA of 8th semester was 6.4.','No',NULL,'Theory, Observations, Computation','I want to study astronomy because it is an exciting and wonderful field.I have a deep interest in this field and curiosity to know what lies beyond earth\r\natmosphere.The cestial mbodies and stars that appear in the sky appear really fascinating and interesting.Often while watching them many questions rise in mind like what is the cause of the origin of the universe and what are the cosmic events that happen in the space. What governs the happening of the various cosmic events.Is there life possible outside earth,if so then what are the most probable celestial bodies.Many times it is heard in the news of Ufos caught by the eyes of people living in different places of earth which further instills a query to know whether  aliens exist in this universe or not.\r\nThe most probable reason for the extinction of dinosaurs was the meteorite hitting earths surface. Hence in the near future what is the probability of having yet another meteoroids enter earths atmosphere.\r\nSimilarily how do other cosmic events that happen in the space can affect life on earth.\r\nAlso one of the latest discoveries , God particle,considered very important, can it become the reason of destuction of the universe also.Hence opting this field would be a great opportunity to find answers to all these queries.

Actually where it is? Is this only one or more?\r\n\r\nIn the case of black holes it attracts all matter even light, where it gains such energy to \r\n\r\nattract even light? Due to this nature black holes are amazing thing in our universe. Since 1453, \r\n\r\nthough numerous research works have been done and also in progress still we know a very little \r\n\r\nabout the universe we live in. \r\n\r\n The most interesting fact is that we can see only 5% of the matter in our universe but \r\n\r\nwhat about the rest? Scientists believe that the rest of the matter is made up of invisible \r\n\r\ncomponents. Why it is so?\r\n\r\n The nuclear bomb blast in Japan reminds us the harmfulness of it but in our solar system \r\n\r\nevery second the sun produces so much energy, which is equivalent to 100 billion nuclear \r\n\r\nbombs. What about this energy...why we are unable to utilize this energy...\r\n\r\nIn the 21st\r\n\r\nincluding optical and non -optical astronomy, cosmology, stellar astronomy, galactic astronomy, \r\n\r\nplanetary astronomy and so on.

With the growth in the instrumentation and computational techniques the research is getting much active and attractive as well. The vast dimensional space and the mystery filled inside is actually the part of fantasy. Not only an interesting subject but also provide you new outlook to this worlds creation and working. The sky full of glorious stars and radiations coming for neighboring galaxies are now giving pathway to new branch to physics. The study of our very own Sun has a special place in observational astrophysics. Due to the tremendous distance of all other stars, the Sun can be observed in a kind of detail unparalleled by any other star. Our understanding of our own sun serves as a guide to our understanding of other stars. By taking the spectrum of radiation coming we are able to actually find the chemical composition, temperature, density, mass, distance, luminosity, and relative motion of foreign stars. The working of stars and their lifetime can be predicted by knowing the intensities of the radiations. Also their distance from earth and things travelling many light-years distances. The properties of a galaxy can also be determined by analyzing the stars found within them.\r\nThe light reflected by other non-luminous celestial bodies give the precise information about the presence of minerals, gases, water etc. In short, it helps us to know about our spacial neighborhood. As in today regime we are looking for the possibility of life at other planets and existence of aliens. The kind of analysis people doing is as if we are predicting our future. The life of sun, the gaseous explosion, supernova and black hole are the topics of center of attraction for physics world. The search of reasons for evolution of the universe and spanning initial condition for big bang is also now becoming possible. Modeling, based on the most precise data and calculations currently available, are compared to actual findings of the observable universe in order to better understand the nature of the universe, including galaxy formation, dark matter and dark energy. Due to exploration of computational sciences and programming handling of tremendous amount of data becoming possible as well as feasible. The analysis of data becoming more precise by the evolution in field of instrumentations. It is now possible to analyze each and every line of emission-absorption spectra.\r\nAlthough the scientific discipline of astrophysics has made tremendous strides in understanding the nature of the universe and its contents, there remain some important unanswered questions. Answers to these may require the construction of new ground- and space-based instruments, and possibly new developments in theoretical and experimental physics. These unanswered questions are the portions of research and exploration.\r\nBeing a physics student, I have always wanted to be the part of such explorations. The increasing mystery has also increased the interest. The study of astrophysics and astronomy will take me closer to my dream and explore my knowledge.\r\n','DBT Star College Project Power supply using unijunction transistor','Received awards for academic excellence in year (2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008).\r\nCertificate by Delhi Association of Mathematics Teachers on securing 63% marks and first position in area in Level Mathematics Olympiad Contest in 2007-2008.\r\nCertificate by Delhi Academy of Geography Teachers on securing 62% marks in Senior Secondary School Geography Talent Search Examination in 2007-2008.\r\nHonored by Punjabi Academy, Delhi for securing third position at state level in Punjabi.\r\nHonored by Rachna Sagar PVT.

But being grown up in an academic environment I accepted science as my path in this quest. I believe that modern cosmology with the help of developments in astronomical observations have the potential to solve many puzzles of the universe. And it has been my dream to join the scientific community to help them realize this dream.\r\nAs a child our scientific journey begins by being awestruck by the glittering moon in the night sky. Crowded with innumerable questions about astronomical entities a childs intrigued mind advances towards more and more surprises of the world. In this journey sometimes encounters with different aspects of life eventually changes our dream and course of life. But fortunately or unfortunately being spent twelve years of my life in residential institution very few aspects of life have influenced my life so far and I still preserve that childish mind.\r\nWhen I was in class six one night our hostel in charge arranged for a telescope and we got a glimpse of moons craters. That day for the first time I felt bigger than myself and a feeling of oneness with the universe pervaded my mind for long time. That feeling which is the driving force for many great scientists , philosophers and writers has been my most cherished experience.\r\nSince class six a long time has passed by. In the mean time in the vicious cycle of expectations, peer pressure and poor grades I was lost for a while. But as graduation was nearing a hope of new beginning awakened me. I eventually followed my heart and decided to pursue higher studies in cosmology and astrophysics. From fourth year I started taking courses related to cosmology and astrophysics. In the last summer I also did a reading project on cosmological perturbation theory under Professor Kaushik Bhattacharya. And there I got to know about Big Bang, Inflationary models and quantum cosmology. All these activities have helped me revive my interest in this field and that feeling of oneness. Finally now I am working on quantum cosmology with Professor Bhattacharya as a part of my graduation thesis.  And in future want to continue research work in this field.\r\nIn the end I want to say that the relentless efforts that thousands are putting to understand the clockwork of the universe has made me realize that we as human however small we are, our dreams are certainly much bigger and I want to be part of this collective dream.\r\n','I have carried out two projects and one is currently going on.\r\n\r\n1)Study Of Classical Cosmological Perturbations(IITK, Dr. K Bahttacharya)\r\n&amp;#61607;	Big Bang and inflationary models of the universe.\r\n&amp;#61607;	Study of perturbed Einstein Equation.\r\n&amp;#61607;	Evolution of cosmological perturbations.\r\n&amp;#61607;	ADM formalism and variational principles in GTR.\r\n\r\n2)Klein Paradox in Different Spin Dependent Potentials(IITD, Dr. V Ravishankar)\r\n&amp;#61607;	Introduction to relativistic quantum mechanics.\r\n&amp;#61607;	Klein-Gordon equation, Dirac equation and Lorentz transformation properties of spinors.\r\n&amp;#61607;	Understanding the Klein Paradox.\r\n&amp;#61607;	Possibility of Klein Paradox under different kinds of spin dependent potentials..\r\n&amp;#61607;	Evolution of wave packets in these potentials.\r\n\r\n3) Quantum Cosmology(Msc. thesis, Dr. K Bhattacharya)\r\n&amp;#61607;	Study of different bouncing models of cosmology.\r\n&amp;#61607;	Boundary conditions in nonsingular cosmology.\r\n&amp;#61607;	Analysis of Quantum mechanical version of Wheeler-Dewitt equation.\r\n','I have been receiving inspire scholarship since 1st year.','','Yes','Selected','No','No','2014-09-19 19:22:12'),(700,'sujit anil kadam','1993-06-01','Male','INDIAN','ksujit17@gmail.com','A/P.KENJAL TAL.WAI DIST.SATARA','412535','Wai','Maharashtra','9657541681','NEW ARTS COMMERCE &amp; SCIENCE COLLEGE, LAL TAKI ROAD, AHMEDNAGAR.','414001','Ahmednagar','Maharashtra','General','Xth Std','T.L Joshi Vidyalaya, Wai.','kholapur board',2008,'A',66,'XIIth Std','kisan veer college, wai.','kholapur board',2010,'C',47,'B.Sc.','kisan veer college,wai.

Astronomy was particularly appealing because it addressed some of the most basic questions of who, what, and where we are in the universe. I find that astronomy is a fascinating subject to work in, because we deal with so many different and exotic objects and it is also very rewarding because the general public is often very interested in it. \r\nI have been interested in all the sciences especially in Physics since my primary school. When my teenage years came along, I decided that I would pursue a career in science. My undergraduate and post graduate education in Physics has provided me with a strong and comprehensive background in Physical Sciences. The curriculum included all the basic courses such as quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, classical mechanics, optics and solid state physics. My M Tech course in Optoelectronics and optical communication and the experience gained from the applied photonics lab., Department of Electrical communication Engineering at the Indian Institute of Science has given me a good insight into the technology as well as pure science. \r\nI am interested in theory as well as experiment. When we deal with extra-terrestrial or heavenly bodies, we actually make communication link with the heavenly bodies. That communication, like any other communication systems, mainly includes transmission of signals produced by or generated from a source, transmission through a medium and detection by a receiver. The source may be man-made or natural and the signal may contain information as well as noise (unwanted information). In order to get a good conclusion an astronomer has to extract and analyze the exact data from the raw data received from optical or radio sources which is collected using electronic or optical instruments. So knowledge about the equipment design and its engineering is also important. I have worked in two research projects namely, 1) Design of optical fiber distribution network for transmission of RF/digital signals using wavelength division multiplexing for radar applications and 2) Generation of modulated microwave signals using integrated optical techniques. I believe that my academic training and experience will make me a fit for a good researcher your organization.\r\nAn opportunity to work in the stimulating environment at IUCAA will certainly make the study a rewarding exercise and a satisfying experience. In terms of research facilities also, a university like IUCAA has more to offer to a research student.\r\n','1) Design of Optical Fiber Distribution Network for Transmission of RF/Digital Signals Using Wavelength Division Multiplexing for Radar Application\r\n2) Generation of modulated microwaves using integrated optical techniques','nil','nil','No','Rejected','No','No','2014-09-19 20:21:26'),(705,'Atanu Kabiraj','1993-10-02','Male','INDIAN','atanu.kabiraj2@gmail.com','BOSEPARA,BUNIADPUR,\r\nSOUTH DINAJPUR','733121','Balurghat','West Bengal','9593856698','K.N.C ROAD, BARASAT,\r\n24 PARGANAS (NORTH)','700124','Barasat','West Bengal','General','Xth Std','BADALPUR HIGH SCHOOL','W.B.B.S.E',2008,'',84,'XIIth Std','BANSHIHARI HIGH SCHOOL','W.B.C.H.S.E',2010,'',81,'B.Sc.','RAMAKRISHNA MISSION V.C COLLEGE','W.B.S.U',2013,'',66,'M.Sc.','BARASAT GOVT.

I was always curious about the evolution of universe. During my school days itself study of stars and the celestial bodies had brought a huge excitement in me. This made me ending up liking physics. The unknown crests and troughs of the heavenly bodies makes astronomy unique. Still the research based on evolution of universe is on the way of advancement. As a student i always look forward a chance to contribute in this area. I know this area deals with the laws that governs the origin and motion of celestial bodies. The real magic happened in the universe always amuses me. I am curious about the mystery behind the origin of universe. And i wish to take up an opportunity to reveal the secrets. Astronomy was particularly appealing because it addressed some of the basic question of who, what and where we are. The area of astronomy is always a flood of queries and attempt to find out the answers. Finding answers means we are solving the questions. This will lead a way to discover a lot of facts. Astronomy leads a way to know about the universe but I think when it advances it will explain our own existence. Knowing and understanding about the world on which we play our life is an exuberant subject.  Astronomy explains about everything that we observe in this universe. I also believe that this study will give me a very solid foundation in both mathematics and physics. Another reason that made me interested in astronomy is the beauty of universe itself.  Observing the sky seems to bring back the feeling of wonder and peace which help me to keep me calm and feel better. Astronomy has always had a significant impact on our world view. In earlier days there was a practice of predictions and prophecies. The history of astronomy also made me so curious. The list of interesting and amazing questions are yet to be answered. Discovering new knowledge always amuses me. Research in the field of astronomy will be so exciting. My interest towards astronomy has improved when I came to know about the wide variety of applications. It finds use in communication sector. Since i am an electronics and communication student i guess i can extend my research on that specific area. I believe i can study an utilize the period fruitfully.','The undertaken academic project was a hand gestured wheel chair with obstacle detection. It find its applications in hospitals, and for the physically challenged people. The wheel chair was a prototype. Hand gestures were recognized by using a sensor known as accelerometer. Accelerometer measures the tilt of the hand by a measuring the varying acceleration due to gravity. According to the signals signals where generated by an ATmega 328 which controls the motor driver thereby motor. Thus according to the signals the wheel chair moves forward, backward, right and left. Obstacle detection was made possible by using n ultrasonic sensor. The input signal was received from ATmega 328 microcontroller itself. If an obstacle is present in front of the chair then it will give input as time back to microcontroller. Time is converted to distance and according to the threshold the wheel chair is stopped.','During my 9th standard I was awarded proficiency award with second position in my class.

','Theory, Observations, Computation','My father and I have a tradition: on our long walks, we have the liberty to ask each other any question we please, be it minuscule, complex, silly or controversial and demand an agreeable explanation. All rules and decorum are dismantled just so we can satisfy our curiosities. These discussions made me observe the world around carefully and developed a habit of questioning till I got to the very fundamental level of understanding. It was this nature of physics, by which complex phenomena can be answered by building on fundamental rules and laws that attracted me to the subject. \r\nEventually this fascination for physics converged to astrophysics and cosmology.  In particular, the fact that the universe may be used as a laboratory to find patterns and verify hypotheses excited me.\r\nI have attended numerous workshops, summer schools and lectures on different aspects of physics. Of these, programmes organised at the JN Planetarium in Bangalore were the most educative and trained us to appreciate the beauty of physics, especially astrophysics, through a series of simple experiments and lectures. As a KVPY fellow, I undertook research projects in various areas. While I enjoyed these forays into other branches of physics, my interest in astrophysics and cosmology was focused by two significant activities.\r\na) Research Education Advancement Program: In this three-year program, professors from the Indian Institute of Science, the Raman Research Institute and the Indian Institute of Astrophysics taught us courses in physics. In a few special sessions, we were taught the coma cluster problem, Zwickys prediction, accelerated expansion of the universe and were also provided an opportunity to work at the astronomical observatory in Kavlur.\r\nb) Internship sponsored by the Indian Academy of Sciences: As an intern at the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics in 2012, I worked on Exploring the evolution of dark energy equation of state under Prof. Debashish Majumdar.  For this project, we analysed the pattern of change in dark energy equation of state [&amp;#969;] as a function of redshift [z]. While doing this project, I was delighted by the fact that cosmology offers interesting opportunities for addressing conceptual issues with empirical approaches. \r\nMy interest is to eventually understand the origin and evolution of the universe and its structural patterns. Recently, when the most distant lensing system was discovered by researchers in Texas A&amp;M in August 2014, they found that the lensing galaxy had less dark matter than expected and dispelled the notion that dark matter and normal matter in a galaxy is accumulated in equal proportions over time. I wish to explore and attempt at answering such ambiguities and in the process, try to solve the relatively less tractable puzzles concerning the origin of the universe. \r\nCurrently, I am an S. Ramsheshan Fellow of Current Science. As part of this fellowship, I have been reading papers related to astrophysics and cosmology and publishing news items on them. This has only strengthened my awe for the subject.   \r\n','1.

It was much later that I realized that what I wanted to be an astronomer and since then I have been working hard in the direction. Taking into consideration my interest, I am currently doing B.Tech. in IT and Mathematical Innovations as mathematics and IT are the foundation stones of modern astronomy. I have done some projects in basic astronomy in my undergraduate years like a theoretical project titled Structure and Evolution of Stars. Currently I am doing a project titled Light curve analysis of variable stars using Fourier decomposition and principal component analysis. \r\n\r\n Given my background in IT, I have a natural inclination towards computational astrophysics. A few days back I heard something that really excited me. Scientists are using algorithms such as Ant Colony Optimization to plan the trajectory of satellite from one planet to the other and exploiting the gravity of the intermediate planets to travel through the cosmos. If the spacecraft is sent exactly at the correct angle through the gravitational field of a planet, it acts like a catapult which is called the sling shot. The main problem is calculating the combination of sling shots. I would like to work on similar lines, given my interest in IT and experience in machine learning projects. Also these days big data analysis plays an important role in astronomy. My VSP project was a computational astronomy project based on big data analysis. Prior to my visit to IUCAA, I had not been exposed to real time astronomy. The project at IUCAA also inclined me towards observational astronomy. \r\nMy minor in college is electronics. I have done several minor projects in electronics like Leakage Current Reduction in CMOS logic circuits and Designing the circuit of a seven segment display. And currently I am working on an embedded systems project to automate the Canteen Management System using RFID technology. Along this I have also worked on experiments at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. Such projects clearly highlight my inclination towards instrumentation. The importance of electronics in instrumentation cannot be undermined. For instance, this is the era of technologically advanced robotic telescopes which are intelligent enough to change their angle according to the source. This is where embedded systems and efficient algorithms are required and my undergraduate course work has equipped me with sufficient skills for the same. \r\nThe teaching  learning methodology at Cluster Innovation Centre is based on hands - on activities. I have done a helluva lot of projects in my undergraduate level and that has equipped me with the right ingredients for a promising research career. \r\n','I have tried to skillfully combine my majors and interest in physics. For instance, I have worked on a project titled Statistical Methods to Detect Higgs from Particle Accelerator Data Using Digital Event Processing. It was a simulation project wherein pseudo data comprising of signal and noise was generated and then the original signal was obtained using digital signal processing. I have worked on several other projects which involve physics and simulations. For instance, I simulated Molecular dynamics based on Lennard  Jones potential and also a system of coupled oscillators. My interest in experimental physics is evident by project titled Development of Induction based Electro Magnetic Accelerator: Tools and Techniques at BARC.  It was an experimental project investigating characterization of solenoid coil employed in induction based accelerator. My work primarily focused on self-inductance measurement of various types of coils and measurement of the magnetic field of a solenoid.','1.Secured All India Rank 221 and State rank 10 in the 3rd Nationwide Interactive Maths Olympiad by EduHeal Foundation.\r\n2.Secured a rank within top 0.1% in Mathematics and Social Studies in A.I.S.S.E (10th), 2009.\r\n3.Secured All India Rank 238 in 11th National Science Olympiad 2008.\r\n','I appeared for GRE General Test on 8th August 2014 and scored 150 in Verbal Reasoning, 166 in Quantative reasoning and 4 in AWA.

Then how much big will be the Jupiter which can accomodate 1300 planets of size of earth! Then how much big will be our sun,our solar system and our galaxy,of which our solar system is only a small part and finally the the universe of which our galaxy is a small part.The another thing which fascinated me the most is the twinkling of stars, the amazing thing is that the most of the stars which we see today are not there today. The light produced millions of years ago by those stars is visible to us today. which is another revealing the distance of stars from us. Big Bang Explosion is another interesting thing.How a single point with dense hot matter exploded &amp; become such a large universe! even though the universe is expanding another interesting question is the possibility of whether the universe will come to an end in a Big Crunch due to the gravitational force of attraction between the matter.

There are so many facts and incidents , some very little and some highly influential. One of the most important of those was a simple thing and that too happened at my 11th standard. My father bought a new television with a new cable connection opening a grand door in front of me, a vastness that still maddens me to follow that same dream I have been dreaming to accomplish. It was that moment I start watching those fabulous TV shows on galaxies, nebula, black holes, dark matter, dark energy and so on. I have no hesitation to admit that this foolish-like story really indeed helped me to ignite the main urge within myself. I decided that day to go for BSc in Physics avoiding all those technical and engineering, medical streams. And so I did. After that gradually my interests grew as I completed each year in graduation. Luckily my college had a telescope that I came to know while getting admission from the brochure, but unluckily we never got a chance to utilize it. Unfortunately I have never got a chance till today but fortunately it helped to keep the ignition on within me. I started attending public lectures of famous people from different parts of the world like Roger Penrose, Rolf Heuer, Kip Thorne, Ashoke Sen, Bikash Sinha and used to ask questions to them, used to take their autographs, all these facts enormously influenced me. After graduation I seated for many entrance exams and got chance in Pondicherry University for doing MSc in Astrophysics but IIT felt better option to choose and so I did. But again ignoring that chance in Astro, no matter how good or ordinary institute that may be, kept my interests aroused. Thus in so many ways I have found reasons to choose Astronomy and astrophysics in future. Now as a student I am sure I am not among the brightest, brilliant, talented ones and that is the only limitation (huge limitation!) that may hinder in my way but I am always ready to work hard with dedication. Some choose Physics according to their merit and some choose out of emotion. I am of the second kind. But I believe thats my strongest point of inspiration and confidence. The journey that started with the little question to my father if there is another earth in the sky and then the realization that the earth itself in between a dark black empty sky and getting excited for the first time in life in the age of 3 must end on a same note and I will try to the best to accomplish this dream.

Many observational data support the big bang theory and among them most important one is the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB) .CMB is one of the finest tool in cosmology for probing the early universe and it has helped to unfold a lot of information about the universe.\r\n   The decoupled photons that are left from the last Scattering Surface (LSS) are still propagating through the universe and we are observing these photons in CMB radiation. So the satellites like COBE and others will give necessary data by recording the temperature and polarization at each point in the sky. From the observations it has been measured that temperature of CMB today is approximately 2.73 K with an anisotropy to the order of 1/10000.\r\n   So I am interested in decoding the information from the observational data obtained from the experiments. Initially we get contaminated map having CMB signal and other noises and then we have to remove all the foreground emission to get a clean map. From this I am primarily interested in the exploration of the various cosmological parameters. The estimate of cosmological parameters answers lot of questions like whether the universe is flat or not? The epoch of matter, radiation and dark matter dominated universe? Age of universe? Amount of dark energy in the universe and epoch nucleosynthesis?  And many other things also. So thus by determining the best fit cosmological parameter values we would be able assign a model to a data set. Also when we consider the power spectrum of CMB in multipole space, at low multipole values the observational results show lot of deviations from the theoretical predictions. These regions in the power spectrum correspond to the Inflationary epoch and has to be resolved. This means the Inflationary theory has to be modified or a new physics has to be implemented to solve this problem .When this problem is solved more information about the Inflation can be extracted and that will give a better picture.\r\n  Therefore the best estimates of cosmological parameters can reveal a lot of information of universe from the beginning to till now. The Inflation is one of the hypothesis that supports Big bang and fixing the problems in the inflationary regime in power spectrum can increase the reliability of Big bang theory. Origin and development of universe has always been a puzzle for me and it helped me to bring a lot of interest in this field.\r\n','In summer 2012 I did a theoretical project under Dr. Prateek Sharma in IISc Bangalore through the IAS\r\nfellowship.

Astrophysics in particular is most interesting of all, as it covers wide range of topics from the start of time, the big bang to the evidence of exoplanets. In my schooling, I was keen to read topics related to astronomy through popular books. In my under graduate studies,  I got opportunity to participate in 4th Inspire Internship Program/Science Conclave : A Congregation of Nobel Laureates and Eminent Scientists, at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad.  There, I met Prof. Jayant Narlikar and had a panel discussion with him on research trend in Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics. At first to pursue my interest, I became a part of the amateur big bang astronomy club.  My first actual experience in radio astronomy came in the summers of 2013.  I  did  Project  on  NASAs  Radio  Jove under the Guidance of Dr.K.N.Pathak and Dr. Vipul Kheraj. The purpose of this project was to describe the construction of the Antenna basic radio receiver and observation of the Sun using the receiver with  computer  software  (Radio  Skypipe  II and Jupiter pro). After this I also attended the Radio Astronomy Winter School 2013 at NCRA, Pune. It helped me to gain knowledge of formal astronomy and astrophysics topic through various introductory lectures. I presented the poster on cosmic magenetism based upon my short reading. In summer of 2014, I got an opportunity to work on study of type II bursts using e-Callisto spectrographs in the suns corona under the supervision of Prof. Subramanium Ananthakrishnan as a summer fellow of Indian academy of sciences. This project helped to deal with real research problems using IDL programming and sensible interpretation of the results.

I believe I am capable to carry out research in this exciting as well as challenging field and to push myself hard to achieve the goal as I am well aware that it would not be an easy walk.\r\n\r\nI hope my application will be considered as an addition to your prestigious research program.','The project that we carried out in the last year of Engineering is titled \"Wireless  Power theft monitoring system using Zigbee technology\".\r\nPlease find here abstract on the project :\r\nThere is always a contract between the consumer and the supplier that the consumer will pay for the electricity consumed by him.

Many talks and seminars about astrophysics helped me to create a beautiful thought in my mind. I always wanted to know the physical principle behind the working and the occurrence of certain astronomical objects. More over my first question was how the universe has evolved and where did the planets and stars come from. To explore these interesting phenomenon I used to dig in to our library often. Even though I was limited with the facts when i completed my graduation, I realized that i still have that interest in me which was even more compared to earlier. My college had an astronomical telescope in which  our professors used to call us for watching certain stars and objects at night. That indeed cultivated my interest about the subject.

In schools the stories of gailileo, tycho brahe, copernicus, kepler served to me a great source of inspiration. Their quest towards untravelling the truth  about motion of heavenly bodies always gave me motivation. gailileo and copernicus struggle for establishing the truth in the lights of scientific rationality have always instigated me to work in a field which has still wide upon , a field which has still have many truths conceded. while I grew up and during my undergrad years, I came in contact with topic like , fluid mechanics , quantum mechanics, plasma , statistical mechanics , classical mechanics , central force problem, virial theorem, red shift doppler effect etc. which has given me a bit of insight of field of astrophysics. I become more interested in learning about the physics behind celestial objects, their motion, thermo dynamics all have become a major inquistion. With advent of relativistic physics in my post graduate classes of with aid of Tensors I have become interested in the field of general theory of relativity , cosmology, string theory. In this regard feet like mentioning yet another legendary figure whose life story and his perseverance has inspired me and he has Prof. Ashoke Sen, it is when he was given fundamental physics prize, I become more more interested in theoritical physics unfortunetely our university has does not offer course in astronomy &amp; astrophysics and since I want to learn more about astronomy and astrophysics .

At udaipur, at our university , we had an active research group on X-Ray binaries &amp;pulsars and by attending many Phd. viva voce, in my M.Sc.(prev) classes i feel determined to do a research in field of astrophysics and astronomy . i also like the obesrvation field of astro physics and astronomy I am so curious to know about the astronomical phenomenon in the universe. while I grew up in during my undergraduate years I come in contact with topics like fluid mechanics statistical mechanics quantum mechanics plasma virial theorem red shift doppler effect ,gamma ray burst, which has given me a bit of insight of astrophysics I become more interested in learning about the physics behind celestial objects their motion , thermodynamics all have become a major inquistion. In This regards works student of our university rahul sharma and dibeyendu nandi (IISER-kolkatta) have also given interest to know in this field as well. aprt from this , new field like astro particle physics astrophysical fluid dynamics and application of non linear dynamics to astrophysics have also caught my attention. In the end I want to tell my interest towards astronomy and astrophysics will always be in a increasing way.

It allows us to detect and study the celestial objects, find the reasons behind their particular behavior and to study their effects on the universe. For instance Solar Astronomy helps us to study the solar activities and find its effects on the solar system. It allows us to study many new galaxies, formation and destruction of the number of celestial objects and answer a lot of unanswered questions and mysteries. With the help of technology we can increase the expanse of our research and try to reach new limits. Astronomy gives us the chance to continue finding many unknown and unseen galaxies. It allows us to find the origin and existence of the vast universe itself.    ','   In the third year of my B.E I did an individual project on Infrared security System to detect intruders. Basically I had used IC555, Infrared LED transmitter an an infrared receiver.\r\n    For the final year project I did a project on Automatic power factor controller using capacitor banks. I had used a current transformer and a voltage transformer to obtain the 2 signals which were then given to zero crossing detector and then the phase difference between V and I was calculated using microcontroller 8051. It was displayed on LCD and corrected using capacitor banks through relay. This corrected Power factor value was then displayed on the LCD display. Power factor correction reduces phase difference between current and voltage and in turn reduce the losses.\r\n ','I won the State Level Chess championship twice and represented Maharashtra in the National Level Tournament.\r\nIn second, third and fourth year of engineering I lead my team and won Lead College Championship. \r\nI had received merit certificates in Dnyaneshvari and essay competitions.\r\nI was a member of Electronics Engineering Students association.

The sheer vastness of the sky used to fill me with awe. I started reading science in general and took deep interest in maths. I was always interested in the stars. When I was in high school, I read a book about black holes. That was the first time I came to know about these bizarre heavenly bodies. This filled me with surprise about what other counter intuitive bizarre things are in this universe. I also came across Dr. Chandrasekhars book on stellar evolution. He explained in very lucid terms stellar evolution. At that time I could not understand all the maths but I got the basic essence of it. Astronomy and astrophysics started to attract me and I decided that I will take it up as my career option. I was amazed at how humans beings in a small planet is observing the universe and is able to extract information about stars, planets millions of light years away, how using only our intelligence we have been to understand the life cycle of a star when the average life time of a star more than many -many generations. Hence in college I decided to do a masters degree in physics. I took relevant courses like Physics of universe, General theory of relativity, magneto-hydrodynamics, plasma physics etc. to make myself better equipped.  During these courses I came across many new concepts which increased my interest in astrophysics. I came across different instabilities like Jeans instability, Parker instability, etc. which are responsible for star formation. I read Stellar structure and evolution by Prinalik and learned about stellar evolution, its different stages and factors influencing it. I also was a member of astronomy club of my college and regularly took part in observation sessions. In the summers of my second, third and fourth year I did research projects in which I got exposure to some current research topics. I was able to interact with scientists and students working in this area. Through this I got to know about research topics apart from the topic on which I was working. These only increased my interest in astrophysics and strengthened my desire to work in this field.','SWIFT flux data of both short and long duration GRBs was collected from NASA database and bolometric isotropic gamma energy, fireball energy and efficiency was calculated. The results were consistent with the internal shock model. A correlation between fireball energy and isotropic energy was derived, which is statistically significant considering the large number of GRBs considered.\r\nIn another project I did a statistical study on accretion induced collapse of white dwarfs to form binary millisecond pulsars. For this purpose i used a stellar evolution code and evolved a large number of stars from main sequence till Hubble time.\r\nPresently i am working on Instabilities in astrophysical plasmas in my masters project. In this I have derived a dispersion relation for Parker-Jeans instability in presence of tides. I have also planned to do a non-linear study of magneto-rotational instability.\r\n','I received academic excellence award in IIT Kanpur for exceptional academic performance in 2011-2012 and 2012-2013.','','Yes','Selected','No','No','2014-09-20 15:42:43'),(754,'ANSHU','1987-08-20','Male','INDIAN','sarathe.anshu@gmail.com','MQ-2939 SHOBAHPAUR COLONY PO-PATHAKHERA DIST-BETUL M.P-460449','460449','Betul (MP)','Madhya Pradesh','8506940171','MQ-2939 SHOBAHPAUR COLONY PO-PATHAKHERA DIST-BETUL M.P-460449','460449','Betul (MP)','Madhya Pradesh','OBC','Xth Std','K.V.SARNI','CBSE',2005,'A',77,'XIIth Std','K.V.SARNI','CBSE',2007,'A',67,'B.E.','BITS BHOPAL','RGPV BHOPAL',2011,'A',74,'NULL','','',0,'',0,'BE ELETRONICS AND COMM','2011','PRABHAT SHARMA PROFESSOR BITS BHOPAL','ANAMIKA SHARMA HOB ELECTRONICS DEPT BITS BHOPAL','no','No',NULL,'Theory, Observations, Computation','BECAUSE I WANT TO DO RESEARCH AND INVENT NEW THINGS ABOUT UNIVERSE.','','RASTRAPATI AWARD AND GOVERNOR AWARD  IN SCOUTS.\r\nUNO SCHOLAR.\r\nBIO AND MATHS OLYMPAID TOPPER.\r\nNTSC SCHOLAR.\r\nNSTSSCE SCHOLAR','','No','Rejected','No','No','2014-09-20 15:45:48'),(755,'SHAILENDRA NANDKISHOR POTDAR','1993-08-14','Male','INDIAN','shailendra.potdar@gmail.com','1218/9, C/O MR.

This is due to a very steep energy\r\nspectrum. To make this point more clear, one roughly expects to observe less than one particle per\r\nkm2 in one century exceeding energies larger than 1020 eV. To overcome the limitation of low statistics,\r\nlarger and larger cosmic ray detectors have been deployed. Todays largest cosmic ray detector\r\nis the Pierre Auger observatory (PAO) which was constructed in the Pampa Amarilla in Argentina. It\r\ncovers an area of 3000 km2 and provides the largest set of observations of ultra-high energy cosmic\r\nrays (UHECR) in history.\r\nA second difficulty in understanding the origin of UHECR should be pointed out: Galactic and extragalactic\r\nmagnetic fields might alter the direction of even the highest energy events in a way that they\r\ndo not point back to their source.\r\n    i want to continue further research in this topic. that is why i have apeasent wish to join ur institute\r\n','','','',NULL,'Rejected','No','No','2014-09-20 15:57:33'),(759,'sagar waingade','1990-10-05','Male','Indian','waingadesagar@yahoo.in','At/post- Sambare\r\nTal- Gadhinglaj\r\nDist- Kolhapur','416504','Gadhinglaj','Maharashtra','02327270241','Space and Earth Science laboratory,\r\nDepartment of Physics,\r\nShivaji University,\r\nKolhapur.','416004','kolhapur','Maharashtra','General','Xth Std','Kalmeshvar vidyalaya, Sambare','Pune Board',2006,'A',62,'XIIth Std','Shivaji junior college,Nesari','Pune Board',2010,'B',58,'B.Sc.','Shivraj college, Gadhinglaj','Shivaji Uni.

Since then there has been hardly a day when I have not pointed my eyes in the sky.I applied simple astronomical facts to see myself and verify those facts and theories. As an example, I tested the fact that stars twinkle and planets do not, since planets are way closer than even the nearest star Proxima Centauri that lights reflected by them from our Sun do not loose their intensity much due to atmospheric distortion. In the early days of my cosmological observations I was just confined to observation of stars and tracking down planets and their trajectories esp. Venus as it was easy to locate in evenings of winter. I also made a habbit of forming constellations by joining stars as dots and test them if they really look like the name given to them such as Orion( one of my favorite and also very easy to locate), Cassiopei, Lyra etc. I also made few constellations of my own. Also have a continuous habbit of looking at some particular objects such as Pleiades, Orion Nebula ( though its fuzzy with the naked eye ), Andromeda galaxy ( also visible as a fuzzy patch near the horizon during early evening ). Never lost any of the solar and lunar eclipses apart from those situations where clouds made hinderence. Also got the rare chance of watching Venus transit in 2012 through solar glasses. Few months ago my confinement to cosmological distance limited to my eye ended when I was gifted a Celestron 15*70 binocular by my parents noticing my interest in the night sky. Then I was amazed by the fact that how clear and crisp the objects were visible through it that once were fuzzy and patchy with the naked eye. My range of objects increased exponentially and I started spending lots of time with my binocular. Planets were easy to locate, I watched Jupiter and its four moons and used to note down their relative positions every day ( got the idea from Galileo ), also spotted several Messier objects.\r\nEver since physics was introduce in standard 7, since then I have a great appetite for it. This inclination got intensified when a whole lot was to study in standard 11th and 12th.

But what makes me interested, was the first time I had ever looked through a telescope. It made me realize that Saturn was real and not just an image from a colouring book or cartoon, it was there. Astronomy has always been my passion since my childhood. I started looking at the pictures in astronomy books before I could even read. The pictures were beautiful,fascinating and intriguing. As I grew up I wanted to know all about what those pictures meant. Perhaps I like astronomy because we, personally, are a way of the Universe experiencing itself, or that we are all made of star-stuff, as Carl Sagan so elegantly put it. Knowing and understanding the stage on which our life is being played is crucial for any existence to have real meaning. Astronomy is a science that seeks to explain everything that we observe in the Universe, from the comets and planets in our own solar system to distant galaxies to the echoes of the Big Bang. By studying the cosmos beyond our own planet, we can understand where we came from, where we are going, why is the universe organized as it is? Are we alone? And how physics works under conditions which are impossible to recreate on Earth. But above all astronomy has shown us how insignificant the human physical existence is, and how great the human mind with an intelligence that is now embracing a dazzling range of phenomena, from the astronomically large to the infinitely small. I have very little doubt that what astronomy will still give us in the future will dwarf all of its past contributions by comparison. I am motivated by curiosity and a deep desire to understand some of the grandest and most beautiful phenomena in the universe, as well as a desire to share these wonders with others. To me, research is often a bridge to an ambitious goal - a bridge that needs to be crossed in steps. The payoff is huge! The end result is that I get to think and know more about the entire Universe!!!','Completed a project on \"Wireless controlled robot by PC\" in the pre-final year of Engineering.

It is a quest to understand the answers to the ultimate  questions of our existence and evolution.

Its a top research area in India with many institutions of international repute. Topics in Astrophysics like relativity and quantum nature of gravity have captured my imagination and I think it  transcends physics and enters into the realms of metaphysics and philosophy.

When I was in childhood I always interested to astronomy. Well these are the object we can only see and predict the mysteries behind that. For me, it was the first time I had ever looked through a telescope. It made me realize that Saturn was real and not just an image from a coloring book or cartoon. It was there.I was curious as to how all these Heavenly bodies were there just wandering about so perfectly. Questions like How the universe was formed?, Why do planets move?, Where does sun come from?, etc were always in the back of my mind. None of my family member or friends could give me answers so i took to research. I started reading articles on the internet related to space and astronomy. I learned various new things on the internet, some of them very useful. And it was then that i started my habit of reading. By the way cosmology is a vast chapter merely it consist of thing like black hole, galaxy, meteoroids, star, supernova, many planets, etc. Till now I have learns a little bit of cosmology. Well the concept of space and astronomy start from big bang. Before big bang there was noting in the universe. But after the big bang there are only energy and various gases. The gaseous element literally forming the particle and they gradually stick with gravity. When gravity work the gaseous element automatically compressed and they form the energy so, that the galaxy and star are form. As I read more and more I came to know about the big bang theory and the creation of the universe. I was fascinated as to how everybody in this world that has mass came from a single particle i.e. the Higgs Boson or the supposedly god particle. I wanted to learn more about the particle and i came to know about CERN and their experiment with the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). I became interested in the research. It became a goal in my life to do research at CERN as i wanted to learn more and more things in the field of particle physics. Whenever anyone asked me what I wanted to do research in I always used to say particle physics. Due to its similarity with nuclear physics people thought i was talking about it and used to ask me jokingly if i was going to make an atomic bomb. That is the main reason I am applying to IUCAA because i know that here i will find people like me, who are excited for a new discovery, who have the passion for study, who want to contribute to the scientific community and science which has evolved us from apes to humans.','My M.TECH project was Test Suite Reduction Using Priority Cost Technique. Effective testing can develop quality software with higher productivity at a lower cost. As the software is modified and new test cases are added to the test suite, the size of the test suite grows and the cost of testing is also increases. In order to reduce the cost of testing researcher have investigated the use of test suite reduction technique. Redundancy in test suite increases the execution cost.

After passing out, I joined TIFR Mumbai as a Junior Research Fellow. I worked on Calibration of CZT Imager of ASTROSAT satellite with Prof. A. R. Rao of the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at TIFR Mumbai, for one year. My work involved analysis of the calibration spectra of CdZnTe (CZT) detectors using XSPEC and programs in IDL. I also designed and carried out experiments for calibration of CZT Imager at Vikram Sarabhai Space Center when the payload was shifted there for testing.','Yes','I had applied for IUCAA Introductory Summer School on Astronomy and Astrophysics in 2012 and also attended the school. I got to learn about various research areas in Astronomy and Astrophysics in the school. I also did a reading project on X-Ray Astronomy under supervision of Prof. Gulab Chand Dewangan. At the end of the school, I gave a poster presentation on X-Ray Astronomy. I had also applied for INAT 2013 but was not able to crack the written test.','Theory, Observations, Computation','The sky and the stars and planets in the sky have been a subject of fascination and curiosity to the mankind since ancient times. I believe that the urge to acquire knowledge about the outer space, or the Universe, has been a driving force behind all the development of science and technology that we have witnessed. The rocket technology and the satellite communication technology have been the fruits of our efforts to send satellites into the space to observe stellar objects. The urge to find the origin of universe is the primary and overall motivation behind present-day particle physics. Finding the origin of very high energy particles observed in cosmic rays has been one of the major objectives of LHC experiment. Huge investments are being made in experiments like LIGO and IndiGO which are aimed at observing gravitational waves.\r\nAstronomy and Astrophysics is not a very specific research area in physics. It includes nuclear physics, atomic and molecular physics, and particle physics etcetera. Observational astronomy even includes optics, photonics, semiconductor physics and electronics. Studying Astronomy and Astrophysics, thus, I feel, gives an opportunity to explore wide areas of physics and provides a gateway to understand the nature.\r\nI developed interest in Astronomy and Astrophysics in my childhood. Newspaper articles about astronomy, astronomical objects such as stars, galaxies, planets and astrophysical phenomena fascinated me and my school teachers stimulated my interest about mathematics and physics. I made a 50 page presentation cum report on Life-cycle of Stars as a science project in 10th standard for which, I secured second prize.\r\nIn last four years at IIT Bombay, as an Engineering Physics student, I was formally introduced to the early and contemporary developments in physics and to the numerous branches of physics. I attended the Introductory Summer School on Astronomy and Astrophysics at IUCAA last year. In the summer school, I learned various aspects of Astronomy and Astrophysics. I did a reading project in X-Ray astronomy with Prof. Gulab Chand Dewangan during the month long summer school. At the end of the school, I gave a poster presentation on X-Ray Astronomy. The project exposed me to the basics and details of X-Ray astronomy.\r\nAs a JRF working on Calibration of CZT Imager payload of ASTROSAT satellite, I got a hands-on experience of analysis of X-ray spectral data using modern spectral analysis tools available. After the payload was shifted to Vikram Sarabhai Space center, I planned and executed the calibration experiments of CZT Imager there. The outcome of those experiments is going to be used for generating the response of the CZT Imager. Having worked on this project has just motivated me more to pursue higher studies in Astronomy and Astrophysics.\r\nI want to do research in Astronomy and Astrophysics and I feel confident about myself that I will be able to make some contribution towards development of our understanding of the Universe.','As JRF under Prof. A. R. Rao, I worked on the calibration of the CZT Imager of ASTROSAT satellite. I used XSPEC for the analysis of the CdZnTe(CZT) spectra and also learned a high end programming language namely IDL for the analysis purpose. As a leader of the calibration team from TIFR, I planned and executed multiple sets of calibration experiments at Vikram Sarabhai Space Center(VSSC), when the payload was shifted there for testing. The purpose of the calibration experiments was to study the detector behavior at various conditions of temperature and threshold, identify best detectors for sending to the space and generate data for the formulation of the response matrix of CZT Imager. The experiments were hugely successful and one outstanding result of the calibration was that we succeeded in achieving a threshold as low as 10keV for most of the detectors, which was never tried before at TIFR.','','','Yes','Selected','No','No','2014-09-21 12:58:50'),(809,'MRITUNJOY PRASAD GHOSH','1992-04-27','Male','INDIAN','mritunjoyghosh2013@gmail.com','VILL-RASHUDIH  POST- GOPALPUR \r\n P.S-PUNCHA  DIST-PURULIA','723151','PURULIA','West Bengal','9635172253','ST.

I familiar with many subjects but the most I like is the ASTRONOMY. when i was a kid, I always watched stars and thinking of where they came from and while asking to my mother she told me they were form when the good people went to haven eventually there soul become star.That was the magical view i ever feel. By the time I grown up and start study about the astronomy and I come to know many incredible things and realized that \"some facts are more stranger then the fiction\". I also read many Mythological books at where many miracles &amp; magic are mention over there but I believe that those are nothing but the advance science which are related to advance Biophysics. I got the inspiration from some great people who change the world and devote their whole life to the humanity to discover the most incredible equation E=mc2 from this equation Albert Einstein open the gate of imagination of time travel in 1905 when there were no sufficient instrument to prove this equation but he made it only by some mathematical formulae. I have watched many series of astronomy and read books which is related to it. I really get emotional and excited which encourage me to know more about it, that arise many question such as about the diameter of the universe. There were 14 billion years ago the big band was explode that means the diameter of the universe should be 28 billion light years but experimentally it show that it is much more then that, why it is so? that means when the big-bang was explode initial particles was move more then the velocity of light and still moving with the same velocity. Not only this the other fact is the age of the universe vary from place to place like if we stand near the super massive black hole where time run slower as compare to earth. On that place the age of the universe is slightly less then the frame of reference of earth. Imagine if we made a worm hole whose one door is there at earth and the other one open near that super massive black hole and that worm hole is created at single time of reference so if we travel through it then we reach there on that time which is yet to happen it means we reached in the future. there are many other facts which i cannot cover here but I can explore it while studying. thats the reason I wanted to explore and serve for the humanity and the only way to explore these phenomena is to do I-Phd in astronomy from the premium institute. and i would like to be the part of it. thank-you  ','i have done Intenship in mining indurtry\r\none month practical experience in HZL mines\r\none month practical experience in Kumbarkheni Mines\r\none month practical experience in Corba mines\r\nI have done Project on the topic of Dust Dispersion in mine','','','No','Rejected','No','No','2014-09-21 13:14:06'),(811,'BHASKAR KAHANDAL','1981-06-01','Male','Indian','kahandalbt@gmail.com','At Kahandalwadi Post Wavi Tal Sinnar Dist Nashik','422104','Sinnar','Maharashtra','9270577023','At Kahandalwadi Post Wavi Tal Sinnar Dist Nashik','422104','Sinnar','Maharashtra','OBC','Xth Std','Nutan Vidyalaya Wavi','Nashik',1997,'A',71,'XIIth Std','GMD College Sinnar','Pune',2000,'A',63,'B.Sc.','GMD College Sinnar','Pune ',2003,'B',59,'M.Sc.','SSGM College Kopergaon','Pune',2005,'A',62,'B Ed.

Later, when I was sent to school, there I learned about the universe, the heavenly bodies, the galaxies, the solar systems; I was thrilled to know that our planet earth in which we live, is a tiny part of the huge mysterious universe. I had many questions in mind- How big is the universe? How did it start and what is its fate? Whats out there in deep space? What are the stars and galaxies made of? What makes them shine? As I grew up, my curiosity to unveil the mysteries of the cosmic world grew with me. My father used to tell me about the patterns of the constellations and their names, my mother who is a high school physics teacher also encouraged me to fulfill my dream of studying Astrophysics. So, after my class 12s board examination, I took up physics as my subject of graduation because I wanted to know the basic theories of the main subject before I walked into the cosmic world and studied the physics of the universe.\r\nDuring the period of my graduation and one year of post-graduation, I  did not learn much about Astrophysics. From various science magazines, I came to know that in this branch of physics, among the objects studied are galaxies, stars, planets, extra-solar planets, the interstellar medium and the cosmic microwave background. There I read about the Big bang Theory, the existence of Dark Matter and Dark Energy, the discovery of Black Holes and the discovery of planets around the other stars. These theories and discoveries have answered some of my questions, but out in the space there are so many questions yet to be answered. With my little knowledge about the cosmic world, I am unable to get the answers of my questions; I want to know about expanding universe, stellar evolution,  whether or not time travel is possible, wormholes can form, or the multiverse exists, and the origin and ultimate fate of the universe.\r\n','I have done a summer project entitled Production of Medically Important Isotopes 149 Tb and 167 Tm and Hard Neutron Spectrum in Spallation Reaction under Indian academy of Sciences Summer Research Fellowship Programme 2014, during May to July 2014, under the guidance of Professor Maitreyee Nandy, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Kolkata. \r\nRadioactive isotopes have a wide range of medical applications.

Looking up at the sky makes me realize that there is so much to discover, so much to learn from the universe from the black holes that eat entire galaxies to the singularity at the center of a black hole. \r\nAll of our knowledge about astronomy changed when a German scientist proposed his theory of relativity in 1915. This scientist was Albert Einstein. The theory states that mass can wrap both space and time, hence the bending of light around large masses like stars is explained. This theory had replaced the theory of mechanics which was followed for the past two centuries. Theory of relativity stated that the motion was relative and time depends on velocity of travel. This helped solve various astronomical problems that couldnt be solved by Newtons methods.\r\nHubbles law helped in calculating the speed at which galaxies recede away from the earth. This shows that they are moving away and provides the basis for Big Bang Theory. Scientists later proved that its moving faster than predicted. Using Red shifting measurements, the universes age is currently estimated at about 13.75 billion years.\r\nThen came the Big Bang Theory. It is one of the proposed models of how the universe was formed. The Big Bang was an explosion which led to the creation of Space-Time from nothing. Though there are no certain answers about what happened before or after the Big Bang, it has stood the test of time and widely accepted. \r\nDark energy is something that is newly proposed topic. If the universe is expanding all the time and the speed of expansion is increasing then where is all the energy coming from? This energy is labelled as dark energy which is estimated to be about 74%. \r\nAstrophysics is not just about events happening far away in space but in our own planet too. Nuclear fusion was initially explained by using astrophysics. Experimental evidence for neutrinos was obtained by using astrophysics. Astrophysics is also useful in examples of physics like Paulis Exclusion Principle.\r\nAstrophysics is more than just looking through a telescope. It involves reading papers, listening to scientific talks, debugging code, learning more about the universe. It makes us aware that there is a lot more to life, universe and everything that meets the eye. \r\nI would like to pursue my doctorate in Astrophysics because I feel passionate about the heaven and the skies and I feel I would be able to contribute to the development in this field and bring glory not only to the institution but also the nation.\r\n','No','No','Qualified GATE 2013 - 88.51 percentile -  score 354','Yes','Rejected','No','No','2014-09-21 15:27:13'),(819,'Jitendra Sahoo','1993-06-02','Male','INDIAN','sahoojitendra44@gmail.com','room no 103, new pg hostel, ravenshaw university campus','753003','CUTTACK','Orissa','0671','RAVENSHAW UNIVERSITY\r\nAT- CUTTACK\r\n','753003','CUTTACK','Orissa','OBC','Xth Std','BARAPALLI HIGH SCHOOL','BSE ORISSA',2008,'',89,'XIIth Std','NAYAGARH JUNIOR COLLEGE','CHSE ORISSA',2010,'',84,'B.Sc.','NAYAGARH AUTONOMOUS COLLEGE','UTKAL UNIVERSITY',2013,'',80,'M.Sc.','RAVENSHAW UNIVERSITY','RAVENSHAW UNIVERSITY',2015,'',84,'MSc.

At that time the size of the universe is smaller than an atom but Big bang produce all the matter and energy we know today. It sounds crazy.

The First galaxy formed when the age of the universe only 300 million year old. Now it fills with more than 100 billions of galaxies, each containing at least billion of stars.

What lies beyond earth has always intrigued me.\r\nI wish to further this curiosity by observation of starlight in large spectrum of radiation (astronomy) and making use of theories for prediction viz Newton- theory on Gravitation and more precisely by Einstein- General theory of Relativity (astrophysics). The decades of attempt to reconcile gravity with other fundamental forces has also been my interest.\r\nDuring childhood i came across a book on planet and stars, it captured my attention like nothing. Since then the joy of learning astronomy and astrophysics has never ceased. This curiousity was fueled by clear night skies of residential school Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Dharwad, far from city light pollution. It had splendid display of stars and meteores.\r\nWhen i became the topper of our batch in 12th in my school, my father asked me what gift i wish to have. Without second thought i replied-A Telescope, and bought a basic telescope of 50 mm aperture. I have loved spending nights watching moon, meteor shower especially Perseid meteor shower. I have enjoyed capturing constellations through my simple digital camera with 15sec exposure by connecting it to my telescope tripod.\r\nI learnt more on beauty of Newton theory on Gravitation through Feynman Lectures on Physics, about how simple calculation could predict planets positions if we have initial conditions- position and velocity of all planets. Hubble discovery of expanding universe by observing red-shift in stellar spectra and subsequent calculation of age of universe through Hubble constant, discovery of microwave background radiation, dark matter and dark energy and many other major discoveries in astronomy and astrophysics have always inspired me to learn and in some way i wish to contribute to this field of research.','','','','No','Selected','No','No','2014-09-21 17:17:01'),(826,'Naveen Krishna','1993-05-08','Male','Indian','naveenkrishna21.in@gmail.com','#3-29/1, Garshakurthy,\r\nGangadhara,\r\nKarimnagar,\r\nAndhra Pradesh.','505445','Karimn','Andhra Pradesh','9441744283','Jyothishmathi Inst.of tech.sci.,\r\nNustulapur,\r\nThimmapoor,\r\nKarimnagar.

','Theory, Observations, Computation','A fascination to astronomy and similar aspects of astrophysics was what sparked my interest in physics in the first place. I used to visit IUCAA with my father and over time I decided to pursue physics after school and my interest in astronomy played a huge part in this.\r\nMy motivation to pursue astrophysics and astronomy lies in part because of the very pioneering aspect of this field. Many new discoveries that lead to the creation of new theory and powerful confirmations of existing theories in astrophysics and astronomical study make it an indispensable field in physics. Since the universe and outer space are one of the most powerful \"laboratories\" available to us, it also provides a huge opportunity to study (and discover) diverse phenomenon that may not be feasible (or observable on small scales) in terrestrial labs. The highly fundamental and dynamic aspect of astrophysics and astronomy is what gives me the inclination to pursue my studies in this sector. I have a background of several years of classical, statistical, quantum physics and programming since school (as well as of course, the other standard fields plus several courses in advanced quantum mechanics) which give me a good base to start advanced studies and consequent research for my doctorate. \r\nI am keen to continue my work in this field in the forseeable future and plan to stay on in the field of research (continue on with my post doc and further).\r\n\r\n','I have worked with the supervsion of Professr T. R. Choudhury at NCRA on creating a program to simulate the power spectrum of matter halos in the universe. The initial program made returned results that coincided with known results from earlier literature. The project helped me greatly in learning specific theory related to cosmology and the kind of research that is carried out currently.\r\n\r\nI am also currently working with Professor V. Ravishankar at IITD on my masters project and it is concerned with studying CP violation. At the moment I am studying the basic theory regarding particle physics and CP violation and consulting related literature.','','GRE general score : Verba : 166, Quantitative : 165, Essay : Not yet arrived.','No','Selected','No','No','2014-09-21 18:23:35'),(833,'Pradeep Maithani','1994-05-02','Male','INDIAN','pradeep.maithani000@gmail.com','H.N.-29,VILLAGE-PAW,P.O.-NEWLI,TEHRI GARHWAL,UTTARAKHAND','249161','Tehri','Uttaranchal','8750594541','PRADEEP MAITHANI, ROOM NO.- 136,\r\nH.J.BHABHA HOSTEL,\r\nBHU VARANASI','221005','Varanasi','Uttar Pradesh','General','Xth Std','S.V.M.I.C.

I worked with Dr. Tirthankar R. Choudhuri on analytical models of reionization of the universe.','Theory','Interest in science has been driving me to ask deeper and deeper questions. Hope of finding some answers keeps me indulged in doing science with increasing enthusiasm. I find one of the most fundamental question is how we came into existence. An immature look at the huge sky above our head gives us a notion that questions about existence cannot be answered. But human curiosity never dies. Thats why scientists have been observing the sky carefully to answer these questions. The beauty and universalization of laws of physics has been helping them all along. Over past centuries our understanding of universe has been evolving, starting from vague picture of everything being made from five elements like air, water etc to picture of tiny strings which are nearly impossible to observe; starting from earth being the centre of universe to a picture of infinite universe with no centre.\r\n\r\nExistence of no controlled experiments leads to deviation in scientific methods used in astronomy and astrophysics. It gives a room for the people who can model physical phenomena based on the observations of experimental results on earth. I find this part quite interesting. But the most fascinating fact about science of astrophysics and cosmology is that in spite of drastic approximations and simplifications the predictions of cosmology and astrophysics are extremely correct. For example the observation of the most perfect black body spectrum of CMB, precise observations of orbits of comets. It increases our confidence on physical laws.\r\n In astrophysics we have a wide range of length scales and time scale. It enables us to see the imprints of all the physical laws be it laws of quantum mechanics whose effects are mainly observable on small scales, or laws of Newtonian gravity whose effects are observable mainly on large scales. \r\n \r\nChildhood habit of asking questions eventually led me to pursue science at NISER. After coming to NISER I joined science activities club. I have been nurturing my interest in Astrophysics by participation in astronomy club, lecture series, viewing sessions through 8inch telescope, Physics-open-discussion, science-day celebration and other activities. At NISER I have also given some lectures like stellar structure equations, distance measurement in astronomy. \r\nBased on my interest I have worked on several projects from wide areas of physics like non-linear dynamics, plasma physics, density functional theory, solar physics and cosmology. I worked on the irregularities of solar cycle Indian Institute of Astrophysics during summer of 2013. I also attended IIST winter school towards the end of the same year. During summer of 2014 I came across analytical models of re-ionization as NCRAVSRP. I studied large scale structure formation during the project. Currently I am working on mass functions of dark matter halos.\r\n \r\nIn brief my interest in astronomy, astrophysics and cosmology is based on the hope of reaching closer to answer of our existence by observing beauty of laws of physical laws on wide range of length and time scales and learning to do good approximations based on physical insight.','1) MSc Thesis Project- Mass functions of dark matter halos with Dr. N.

I always wondered about the presence of black holes, dark matter and dark energy. Recently I read about an alternative explanation for dark matter using Modified Newtonian Mechanics (MOND). which explains the origin of strong gravitational pull towards the center of galaxies. \r\nWhen we consider millions of galaxies in the universe and think about our galaxy where sun is only one single star but so important that our entire existence is dependent on it. \r\nSun, a mysterious hot body having such an exotic environment, with its strong pulsating magnetic fields is really a good area to ponder upon. The regular appearance of sun spots, solar flares and solar storms are equally exciting areas of research. During my summer project at IPR i come to know more about the fourth state of matter and its importance in nuclear fusion in sun. \"Nearly 99% of the universe is plasma\" that was quite a striking observation. \r\n I feel that astrophysics is an all in one subject for theories such as general theory of relativity, string theory etc. and it occurs to me has a nice testing ground for these relatively new theories.

And how physics works under conditions which are impossible to recreate on Earth. In astronomy, the Universe is our laboratory! Astronomy provides an example of an alternative approach to the scientific method- observation, simulation and theory. It is an enjoyable, inexpensive hobby for millions of people- the naturalists of the night. But above all astronomy has shown us how insignificant the human physical existence is, and how great the mind with an intelligence that is now embracing a dazzling range of phenomena, from the astronomically large to the infinitely small. I have very little doubt that what astronomy will still give us in the future will dwarf all of its past contributions by comparison.

In long run, that will help in solving many of the biggest scientific and technological problems of the society like energy crisis, catalysmic disatsers, etc. Never has there been such a golden period in the history of astronomy when such important projects like SKA, EELT, TMT, LIGO, LOFAR, JWST, EUCLID, LSST, etc are in the phase of evolution. Also, as the universe is expanding and accelerating so our farthest vision is decreasing day by day. So it must be as soon as possible that we should build these projects and use them to study our cosmos. Also, only recently we have been confirmed about some of the most important discoveries of the human history - Dark Energy and Dark Matter (even if not fully understood, but confirmed of their existence). As we have come to know that Dark matter makes upto about 23% and Dark energy 73% and only about 4% is what we have seen and detected experimentally of the universe, their understanding stands to be the most mysterious part of todays science. Although Einstein proved the mass-energy equivalence more than a century earlier, we are still in search of a safe and easy method of generating energy which is running the economies of the world today. Its not that, advances in technology always solves the problems but it is the understanding the mysteries of how nature behaves that provides the real solution to our problems. I have been part of Oil Industry for almost 5 years and I know it. In particular Radio astronomy is seeing a major event in form of SKA and with NCRA becoming the 11th full member of the international SKA Organisation, we have a major role to play. What Prof. Govind Swarup started in India, its on our shoulders to carry it to its peak. With GMRT (the largest radio telescope) in our hands we are reigning over the lower band of radio frequencies at a good resolving power. As SKA and LOFAR will grow GMRT can be used for more specific surveys but till then we have to use it to its maximum. As we have come to know that nature has worked in such mysterious ways as to support \"creation\" (like neutron is just more massive than proton, if it were same or vice versa, I would not be writing this now, nothing would have been created!) and hence I think the word \"cosmos\" (meaning order) has been used. Theres no doubt that I want to understand the universe and hence my interest in astronomy and astrophysics.','1. Stress analysis of pipe bends at high temperature at IGCAR, Kalpakkam under IAScs Summer Research Fellow Program from 15.05.08 to 16.07.08.

My own long running fascination for the so called heavenly bodies and more recent tryst with particle physics made me ask myself to choose a field that incorporates the best of both worlds and tries to answer some of the most intriguing questions we have ever faced as an intelligent species. The rational choice was cosmology. In the late 20th century, astrophysics and particle physics have merged their ways together and began to walk a more consolidated path towards unification. To understand and standardize the universality of laws of physics is a fascinating path to work on and as a student of physics, I could not find anything more humbling and thought provoking as cosmology.\r\n\r\nMy own interest in the topic drove me to seek out books and research papers to read, videos to watch and lectures to attend.

I am aware of the challenges in modern cosmology, eager to face them and sincerely hope to contribute to the field.','I was selected as a summer research fellow by Indian Academy of Sciences for the summer of 2013 and pursued my summer project under the supervision of Dr. Sukanta Dutta in Department of Physics and Astrophysics, Delhi University.

From Orion, the hunter to pole star to shooting stars in the dark night captured my attention. I was intrigued by the ever changing canvas of sparkling sky with new pattern of stars appearing every night. After reading more about the universe I realized that Astronomy is not only about gazing at stars in picturesque night through telescope but also about addressing some of the most fundamental questions about our existence like who we are, what triggered our origin, where are we in Universe. \r\nPerhaps I like astronomy because we are personally a way of the Universe experiencing itself, or that we are all made of star-stuff, as Carl Sagan so elegantly put it. Astronomy is a science that seeks to explain everything that we observe in the Universe, from the comets and planets in our own solar system to distant galaxies to the echoes of the Big Bang.\r\nThe study of cosmos beyond our own planet helps to understand and discover the underlying secrets of universe. Are we alone living planet in the Universe? How old is our universe? Is there any limit of universe? Does multiple universe exits? etc. \r\nIt is the only science which does not have confined laboratory but has entire universe for observation and computation, and with the emergence of better simulation technology and observation tools the whole new options for research has opened up. Also, it is an interdisciplinary science which requires the tool from other fields like optics, chemistry, atomic physics, computer science, mechanical and electrical engineering, biology, and fluid dynamics which gives me an opportunity to apply the knowledge gained during my graduation to contribute and learn more.\r\nFew of the recent discoveries like Discovery of smallest known galaxy with a super massive black hole, Primordial gravitational waves etc. has deepen my curiosity about the cosmos and led me to pursue Astronomy and Astrophysics as career.\r\n','Worked on Embedded Web base PLC and its Industrial control techniques\r\nIn this project we have used Nano-10 PLC for monitoring and controlling of various industrial applications.

Its about being completely critical, \r\n\r\ncompletely creative. The fact that I am interested in Physics is not just to explore the unknown, but also to \r\n\r\nseek the answer to questions that fascinates us as well as are mysterious to us. Although, curiosity killed \r\n\r\nthe cat, but it helps a scientist to gain perspective, propose a hypothesis. The thrill being that, a scientist \r\n\r\ncan approach a problem, put the pieces of puzzle together by being completely creative.

Its about learning and understanding the mysteries \r\n\r\nof information encoded in space.

Its not just to satisfy my \r\n\r\nown interest or curiosity but to encourage others, to contribute to the world, to become a pioneer in the \r\n\r\nworld, to do tangible contribution for betterment of the society.

I always wanted to be a scientist &amp; wear a lab coat. This dream provides me the motivation and zeal for hard work. I always sought for guidance throughout my school days and it was here that I found out my true interest was to explore the space.\r\nSince then I have never thought of a future unrelated to space. So, I landed up pursuing B. Tech in AERONAUTICAL ENGINEERING, 2000 km away from home. Here I fuelled my interest by studying about astrophysics online. Wikipedia, online blogs, documentaries like ?THE ELEGANT UNIVERSE by BRIAN GREENE? &amp; ?THE FABRIC OF COSMOS?. The more I studied, the more I craved to know. Terms like DARK MATTER, DARK ENERGY, BLACK HOLES, SUPERNOVAS, NEUTRINOS, SUPERNOVA CONDENSATE and STRING THEORY etc. revolved around me day &amp; night.\r\nI developed some ideas of my own but could not get support. Belonging to a middle class strata asking for support &amp; gathering information was all I could do. Books on astrophysics are very costly &amp; so are the journals &amp; it?s very tough to follow a dream without proper guidance.\r\nSo, I finally understood my true calling in life &amp; made a firm decision to follow it by studying astrophysics as my higher field of studies. By studying astrophysics I hope to gain the knowledge and experience to further my own research. I understand that to succeed I will require determination and dedication to my studies which will be provided by the desire to earn the ?lab coat?.

This was one of the main reasons that made me to take Physics.I wanted to understand the stellar evolution and macro structure of universe. The shear size of the universe enthralled me and made me wonder about the comparison of me and the universe. The variety of life forms amazed me and I started to wonder about the possibilities of life other than our planet Earth. As I knew the universe is too big and numerous to be lonely. If one planet can have these many different forms of life then whole universe might be teeming with life beyond the scope of our imagination. So we can state the universe actually is a biological universe. But the next question comes why and how it started?\r\nApart from this there are lot of unanswered questions and mysteries associated with the origin of the universe in me. I dare to ask you always need a beginning if we do not know the ending. What is the true story of the universe? And where do we fit into it?  \r\nDuring my third year of Integrated M.Sc, our university invited a speaker from Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Dr. T. R. Govindarajan. He was talking about the origin of space time itself and how gravity is connected with the space time in terms of General relativity. The concept of curved space time was new to me and it provoked me to develop interest in Cosmology and Astrophysics. Then there were few more talks organised by our university by various experts on origin and evolution of universe. These made me to do my Summer internship in cosmology. During this internship program, I met  few IIT professors working in Gravity, String Theory, Cosmology etc,. I had few interaction session with them which helped to improve my knowledge in this field. \r\nCurrently I am doing a course on Monte Carlo simulations. This is also an useful technique in astrophysics. I have done 2 short term projects in Monte Carlo simulation of clustered population in statistical mechanics. And also from my schooling I was a computer science student. This made me to have an interest in computation. All these are the reasons that made to take up research in the field of Astrophysics and Cosmology.','1. I have attended \"PLANEX\" workshop organised by PRL by January 2014 and there I was part of a mini rover designing project under guidance of Dr. H. S. Mazumdar. In that project we had to make a mini rover with given specifications like robotic arm and also camera attached to it.\r\n\r\n2. I have done a project in Inflationary cosmology as my summer Internship during my 4th year under guidance of Dr. P. K. Tripathy, IIT Madras. The project was based on the paper \"Superconformal Inflationary Alpha Attractors\" by Renata Kallosh, Andrei Linde, Diederik Roest. In this project I had to calculate the primordial spectral indices like primordial tilt and scalar to tensor ratio for various inflationary cosmological models and verify it with the results given in the paper.','During my second year my project in disaster management and control topic was selected as one of the best projects in south zone level of \"Anvesan\" organised by AIU (Association of Indian Universities).','No','No','Selected','No','No','2014-09-22 12:43:30'),(898,'SUDHIR KUMAR PARIDA','1988-03-10','Male','BHARATIYA','sudhiruuindia@gmail.com','ROOM NO 161\r\nPERIYAR HOSTEL\r\nJNU','110067','New Delhi','Delhi','919968819083','ROOM NO 161\r\nPERIYAR HOSTEL\r\nJNU','110067','New Delhi','Delhi','General','Xth Std','ABHIRAM VIDYAPITHA, KARAMALA, PURI','BSE, ORISSA',2003,'',75,'XIIth Std','KANAS COLLEGE, KANAS','CHSE, ORISSA',2007,'',44,'B.Sc.','SAMANTA CHANDRA SEKHAR AUTONOMOUS COLLEGE, PURI','UTKAL UNIVERSITY',2010,'',60,'NULL','N/A','',0,'',0,'B.

Along with studying Physics the fascination became more acute. I was/am very much interested to know more about the stars, galaxies,planets, moons, asteroids, comets, minor planets, and many other exciting objects, the explosive moon that orbits the planet Jupiter, or the moons that revolves around other planets or explore the gigantic canyons and deserts on Mars. My curiosity has been heightened to understand about planets, after the removal of Pluto as a planet by International Astronomical Union, and to know more about meteoroids, the Kuiper belt, Oort cloud, and the Milky Way. I have inspired by the great astronomers like Lagadha, Aryabhatta, Bhaskar (Bhaskar I), Bhaskaracharya (Bhaskar II), Brahmagupta, Varahamihira, Samanta Chandra Sekhar, Johannes Kepler, Galileo Galilei, Sir Issac Newton and Albert Einstien.

I started looking at the pictures in astronomy books before I could even read. The pictures were beautiful, fascinating and intriguing. As I grew up I wanted to know all about what those pictures meant. I am still learning. Perhaps I like astronomy because we are personally a way of the universe experiencing itself, or that we are all made of star-suff, as Carl Sagan so elegantly put it. Astronomy is a science that seeks to explain everything that we observe in the Universe, from the comets and planets in our own solar system to distant galaxies to the echoes of the Big Bang. By studying the cosmos beyond our own planet, we can understand where w come from, where we are going, why is the universe organized as it is? Are we alone? And how physics works under conditions which are impossible to recreate on Earth. In astronomy the Universe is our laboratory! Astronomy provides an example of an alternative approach to the scientific method observation, simulation, and theory. It is an enjoyable, inexpensive hobby for millions of people- the naturalists of night. But above all astronomy has shown us how insignificant the human physical existence is, and how great the human mind with an intelligence that is now embracing a dazzling range of phenomena, from the astronomically large to the infinitely small. I am motivated by curiosity and a deep desire to understand  some of the grandest and most beautiful phenomena in the Universe. \r\n    Studying M.Sc I have read several books including \"Introduction to General Relativity\" by Prof. S. K. Bose, \"Gravity: An Introduction to General Relativity\" by J. Hartle. \"Gravitation and Cosmology\" by Steven Weinberg, \"An Introduction to Cosmology\" by Prof. J. V. Narlikar, etc. These books gave me a wonderful opportunity to know a basic knowledge about our Universe. My teachers Prof. K. K. Nandi and Dr. Arunava Bhadra helped me to understand the subject clearly and also inspired me to love this subject.\r\n    It is my lifetime dream for working something new in this field and gains more and more knowledge about our Universe.

Starting around AD-1500 scientists such as Copernicus,Galileo,Kepler and Newton deduced laws to describe and explain Planitary motion. Finaly in the modern period (1650 to present) scientists began the search for the physical laws (such as the law of gravity) that underlie the observed movements in the heavens.and technical advice such as telescope ,electronics,computers and application of photography and better mathematical techniques (such as calculus) are boosted our research.(but in future world required more improved telescopes and powerful techniques to expand more idea in astronomy).\r\n    The reason why astronomy made interesting on me is that I found the meaning of my life through physics especially through Astronomy. aI realise that my life is so simple because from our current knowledge scientists found that the universe created before 13.8 (approximately) billion years ego and sun has been warming up planets for more than 4 billion years and from the studies of other stars scientists found that it will run out of fuel in another 5 or 6 billion years. even light which come from a nearby galaxy it will take 150,000 years to reach to our home planet if i consider at least this things ( but there is a lot to point out ) as a physics student i know that my life period (0 to 130, avg 60 ) is easily negligible . the years are just like a fraction of second. i am nothing but i know that i am something , i am talented ,cool and i am gifted with extraordinary observation skill and hard working mentality. my life is like an atom or a particle which is in a nuclear reactor or in a nuclear bomb that react with another and with in a fraction of second in a nuclear reaction a lot of things will happen if it is in a effective way there will be a lot of useful energy if it is not in a useful way my life will be waste i do not want be a waste i can contribute something to our developing society through astronomy with use of my talent and investigating mentality. i will never give up my research until my death.i will try provide some energy some energy to humanity.\r\n    And astronomy always keeps me wondering and it is enjoyable.our home the beautiful planet and other planets orbiting the sun, this types systems orbiting the other system , galaxy,local groups,virgo supercluster, etc . mars missions ,astroids ,possibilities of other planet life.etc. there are lot to discover i am excited.\r\n(for motivating my selfand for update i subscribed the Astronomy magazine from USA and Sky&amp;Telescope magazine from Canada).','Yes , myself i have made a basic model  of simple radio telescope using a small dish ,satellite signal finder and one LNB (low noise block). it took around one year to understand the working and importance of radio telescope in astronomy it was incredible. i would like to give just one example in limited words that the spiral shape of our galaxy (milky way) scientists found using radio telescope only.\r\nMy project was very simple .one small dish can focus the small wave length radio wave to LNB(low noise block). and satellite finder will detect and it will make a beep sound and it can show this in its analog display and i was able to detect some radio waves (example : sun in a cloudy day. and some other object which is near to me and noted the reading regularly.)','\r\n First prize in Project ( radio telescope model ) And \r\n First prize in Poster Making ( LHC -

Prof T Sengadhir and Prof V Karunakaran made me realise the power of abstractions and imaginations. One Used to teach maths in  very rigid  with alot of symbols yet extremely fluent and logical and the other professor used to teach in more imaginative ways with pictures in your head. Both techniques are extremely useful and powerful. Through them Mathematics became fascinating and i realised its full potential.

How will the universe End ?\r\nHow Does Quantum Mechanics fits in to cosmology picture ? How To incorporate  the idea of Gravity at Quantum Level? Is the theory of gravity complete ? What is 96% of the universe(Dark matter and Dark energy ) made out of ? Is this universe a biological universe ? Determination of size and structure of the universe ?

Astronomy provides an example of alternative approach to the scientific method-observation,stimulation and theory.\r\nBut above all, Astronomy has shown us how insignificant the human physical existence is.\r\nI am motivated by deep curiosity and deep desire to understand some of the grandest and most beautiful phenomenon in the universe as well as a desire to share these wonders with others.\r\nAstrophysics strike me as one of the most exciting area of research today. Thanks to new observation better methods and more powerful stimulation that we can now hope to answer with reasonable confidence some of the most profound question ever raised.\r\nAstronomy has emerged forever from the old books of mythology to assert itself as an exact science.\r\nI would like to be a part of it.\r\n','Designed DIgital Dice as B.Sc.

Based on strict dictionary definitions, astronomy refers to the study of objects and matter outside the Earth atmosphere and of their physical and chemical properties and astrophysics refers to the branch of astronomy dealing with the behaviour, physical properties, and dynamic processes of celestial objects and phenomena. In some cases, as in the introduction of the introductory textbook The Physical Universe by Frank Shu, astronomy may be used to describe the qualitative study of the subject, whereas astrophysics is used to describe the physics-oriented version of the subject physics. However, since most modern astronomical research deals with subjects related to physics, modern astronomy could actually be called astrophysics. Few fields, such as astrometry, are purely astronomy rather than also astrophysics. Various departments in which scientists carry out research on this subject may use astronomy and astrophysics, partly depending on whether the department is historically affiliated with a physics department and many professional astronomers have physics rather than astronomy degrees.','NO','I have an RJNF Fellowship','No','No','Rejected','No','No','2014-09-22 14:57:40'),(924,'NAVEEN GUPTA','1991-07-23','Male','INDIAN','naveenmsc.du@gmail.com','FLAT NO. 49-A\r\nPOCKET A-9, GOMTI APARTMENT, KALKAJI EXTENSION, NEW DELHI-110019','110019','NEW DELHI','Delhi','08285000078','DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS &amp; ASTROPHYSICS\r\nUNIVERSITY OF DELHI,\r\nDELHI-110007','110007','New Delhi','Delhi','General','Xth Std','ST.

Actually when i met some professors came from IISER Kolkata and BARC, I got much information from them about neutron star. this topic strike in my mind so much time from that time till today and i am giving my interest to know  about  more and more neutron star. from my experience and my own study i will get quite bit about neutron star which  i am describing below.\r\n            A neutron star is a type of stellar remnant that can result from gravitational collapse of a massive star.neutron  star the densiest and tiniest known to exist in the universe, although having only the radius about 10km. neutron star probably appear white to naked eye.\r\n         neutron stars are the end point of stars which inner core mass after nuclear burning s greater than the Chandrasekhar limit for white dwarf but whose mass is not great enough to overcome the neutron degeneracy pressure to become black hole. such stars almost entirely of neutron which are sub atomic particles without net electrical charge and with slightly larger mass than proton. neutrons are very hot and are supported against further collapse by quantum degeneracy pressure due m to phenomena described by the pauli-exclusion principle. \r\n            Some neutron stars rotate very rapidly and emit beam of e-m radiations as pulsars. Gamma ray bursts may be produced from rapidly rotating high mass stars that collapse to form a neutron star. these are thought to be in the order of 10^8 neutron stars in the galaxy but they can only be easily detected in certain instances,such as if they are pulsars or part binary systems. Nonrotating and nonacclerating neutron stars are virtually undetectable.However , the Hubble space telescope has observed one thermally radiating neutron star called RX-J1865635-3754, the most rapidly roatating neutron star currently known PSR- J1748-2446ad, rotates at 716 rotations per second. Some neutron stars are RX-J1856.5-3754 about 400 light years away and PSR-J0108-1431 at about 424 light years.\r\n         I have much studied about neutron star but yet i have some questions that comes in my mind,which i want to clarify and do some research work in neutron star.The questions are, Is there any equation to describe it?What is the relation of neutron star with black hole? Is there any neutron star inside the black holes?

I came to the area via the sky that adds beauty to the night and driven in to vortex through the books of Stephen Hawking.\r\n   In my high school days, I had made a Galilean telescope and later modified to Keplerian. Such interesting ventures improved my outlook towards Astronomy. With the help of computer softwares such as Stellarium, I learned to identify constellations, star clusters, planets. I observed Venus, Saturn, and Jupiter through my telescope. I could observe 4 Galilean moons among the 63 moons of Jupiter. IO, satellite of Jupiter charmed me a lot because of its subtle features. The very day which I made my second telescope, was a day of super moon, and got a golden chance to observe moon much \"closer\". The telescope was later modified due to aberration caused by lens (lens combination was used for eye piece). Another major factor that encouraged me was the presence of good libraries in my institutes.\r\nI like radio astronomy very much because optical astronomy has limitations as only small portion of EM spectrum can be viewed.\r\nDuring my under graduation I got chance to study an elective paper named \"ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS\" which gave me a basic knowledge on the topic. During past semesters of post-graduation in physics, I learned about the fusion process in interior of stars. Also we had an elective paper in plasma physics. The electives I took/wish to take during my post-graduation are Cosmology, Non linear dynamics and chaos, Computational quantum mechanics                                          \r\nI wish to do my M.Sc. dissertation in observational astronomy at NCRA/RRI/IIA or prominent centers of astronomy/observational astrophysics.

Prehistoric cultures have left astronomical artifacts such as the Egyptian monuments and Nubian monuments, and early civilizations such as the Babylonians, Greeks, Chinese, Indians, Iranians and Maya performed methodical observations of the night sky. However, the invention of the telescope was required before astronomy was able to develop into a modern science. Historically, astronomy has included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational astronomy and the making of calendars, but professional astronomy is nowadays often considered to be synonymous with astrophysics.\r\nAstronomy is a natural science which is the study of celestial objects (such as stars, galaxies, planets, moons, and nebulae), the physics, chemistry, and evolution of such objects, and phenomena that originate outside the atmosphere of Earth, including supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. A related but distinct subject, cosmology, is concerned with studying the universe as a whole.\r\nDuring the 20th century, the field of professional astronomy split into observational and theoretical branches. Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects, which is then analyzed using basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. The two fields complement each other, with theoretical astronomy seeking to explain the observational results and observations being used to confirm theoretical results.\r\nAstronomy is one of the few sciences where amateurs can still play an active role, especially in the discovery and observation of transient phenomena and Amateur astronomers have made and contributed to many important astronomical discoveries.\r\n','','','','Yes','Selected','No','No','2014-09-22 15:28:56'),(934,'shahed ahmed','1991-06-18','Male','indian','ashahed43@gmail.com','#443, 10th cross, m.s.ramaiah north city, thanisandra main road','560077','Bengaluru','Karnataka','09663906621','30/1, hennur bagalur rd, doddagubbi','562149','Bengaluru','Karnataka','OBC','Xth Std','florence high school','sslc',2007,'',71,'XIIth Std','indo-asian academy','puc',2009,'',61,'B.E.','alpha college of engineering','vtu',2013,'',64,'NULL','','',0,'',0,'B.E.

With ever growing desire of humankind for land and resources, the requirement for places to be termed as 2nd  or 3rd home planet will certainly exponent with time. In all these happenings, one thing that has proved to be a milestone in space exploration is Indias very economic but remarkable contribution.\r\n\r\nUniverse (or may be MULTIverse) contains amazing creation ranging as small as cosmic dust, to, as gigantic as black holes that could engulf an entire galaxy or even more. Also the analogy between Albert Einsteins Theory of Relativity and statements made in Holy Scriptures of Hindu dharma seems to be correct e.g. it is stated that God travels faster than speed of light(hence he is omnipresence) so Gods one blink equals to a complete era of mankind. That holds true with theory of Relativity as, time will proceed at much slower pace for the person travelling at or faster than speed of light. Lot of mysteries are still unsolved. They may not be un-puzzled completely but with science help, we could at least arrive near to the conclusion.\r\n\r\nHow did we come into existence? Why do we? Are we alone? Are we ourselves aliens on this planet? Why does Moon revolve Earth? Why Earth revolves the Sun? Why Sun revolves Milky Ways centre? Is there something massive at the centre which makes the Sun revolve? Who does Milky Way revolves? And the Universe too revolves something??? Not only outer space, we also need to concentrate on Earth science to solve many mysterious puzzles related to it. How huge water bodies came into existence? Were they formed or brought? Does it have an ALTERNATIVE??? We can say we have no adequate and satisfying answers for anything till date.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when computers were the size of a medium size home of several kilobytes computing ability. Now with the help of nanotechnology they are as tiny as a rice grain but millions times faster. I personally believe that there is very little done and yet most remains to be done. My interest in Universe took a start when I came across a science fact in one of my early school books that said The Universe is so big that light travelling with a speed of 3,00,000km/s would take billions of years to travel from one end to another. Since then my interest in science and technology has gradually increased with time. In Universe either a thing is extremely huge or extremely powerful in whatever direction we may see. There are plenty of opportunities in space exploration through which we can actually contribute to mankind especially in India. With all my past knowledge, skill and desperate will to contribute in astronomy, I believe that I will be able to do justice to the course. I will learn at IUCAA with my eager to learn and apply attitude.\r\n','Minor Project in 7th semester of B.E.\r\nMICROCONTROLLER based HUMAN HEALTHCARE MONITORING SYSTEM using GPS and GSM\r\n\r\nMinor Project in 8th semester of B.E.\r\nMICROCONTROLLER  BASED VEHICLE SECURITY and TRACKING SYSTEM using RF-ID','Attained Silver Merit in 3rd National Cyber Olympiad.\r\nSecured 4th position in school &amp; AIR 2322 in 3rd National Cyber Olympiad.\r\nSecured 1st position in school &amp; AIR 3612 in 7th National Science Olympiad.','Appeared for GATE 2013\r\nScore-535\r\nAll India Rank-4858\r\nCandidates appeared in same paper-152381','No','Rejected','No','No','2014-09-22 16:11:01'),(946,'vikasphysics78@gmail.com','1992-03-07','Male','indian','vikasphysics78@gmail.com','Room No. NA-07 Zanskar Hostel, IIT Delhi, Hauz Khas, New Delhi-110016','110016','New Delhi','Delhi','9958460046','Department of Physics, IIT Delhi, Hauz Khas, ','110016','New Delhi','Delhi','General','Xth Std','R.H.Govt.

Astrophysics has always attracted me with its enthusiastic and mysterious flavour since childhood.  A kind of fantasy.  As I stepped into the depth of the topic, I got interested in the formalism and undergoing researches in the field of cosmology and astrophysics.\r\n  \r\n   I am corrently working on Gravitational waves from different potential sources of detection. As part of my final year thesis, I am trying to find the metric solution due to binary systems in the spacetime which will likely be above the detection threshold of the advanced LIGO project. Apart from the known sources, as of works done by K.S Thorne et.al, Schutz et.al,D. I Jones etc.., relaxing several approximations would give gravitational wave solutions from theoretical perspective eventhough it is beyond the scope of direct detection by the existing observational missions. I believe that gravitational waves, with the emerging current researches in the field, India being a potential collaborator, has a long way to go. The scope of world wide network of ground based detectors like LIGO, VIRGO and GEO 600 are promising to the scientific community. As an alternative means of detection, using pulsar timing arrays, the ripples in the background caused by gravitational waves could be detected by radio telescopes. Working in this field helped me to grow interest in both the theoretical and observational aspects of cosmology.\r\n\r\n  Also I have done a summer project on Introduction to Radio Astronomy and Image Stacking Techniques which gave me an exposure to observational astronomy as well. Being in NCRA for the project has imposed in me a great deal of interest in observational astronomy. I attended the MWSKY conference held during 9-13 december at NCRA-TIFR to mark 50 years of radio astronomy research at TIFR. This gave me an opportunity to attend talks covering all areas of active research at low radio frequencies. \r\n  \r\n  I have ample experience in tensor analysis and basic computer programming background.

While Studying about this field I caught my attention on CMB radiation.The evidence left by the cosmological processes during the origin and evolution of universe.I learned that much research was going on CMB research to collect data about CMB radiation and to analyze it to have a better understanding about the physics involved in evolution of cosmos.I am specially interested in analyzing the power spectrum that can be produced from CMB maps made from the collected in satellite and ground based measurements.The power spectrum when analyzed in very small multipole values shows considerable variations from the expected power spectrum made using the theoretical models.This change in the values can be attributed to the perturbations which were produced during inflation.But to analyze this we will have to remove the foreground effects which becomes predominant at lower multipole values otherwise we will be interpreting the contaminated data which can lead us to wrong results.\r\n                                   To remove this foreground contamination we may be able to use the property of Statistical Isotropy of CMB anisotropy.In this we will be able to use the property of CMB radiation which has the same temperature fluctuation values under different rotation of the sky.For the foreground component the signal will not be uniform under rotation of the sky as the multipoles of the foreground contamination depends on the orientation of the detector with respect to sky.If we can a quantitatively represent this formalism we will be able to combine different maps with weights which uses the Statistical Isotropy property of CMB radiation and it may minimize the foreground contamination of the map. The weights will reduce the contamination without sacrificing the valuble information carried in CMB power spectrum.It is marked by property of being scale independent.It can be used to eliminate the foreground contamination on low multipoles also the detector noice at higher multipoles.It encompasses the inherent qualities of CMB radiation .I am interested in going on with my research work with CMB radiation to have deeper understanding of the universe we live in.','1)Project work under DR:Suvankar Dutta,Assistant professor,IISER Bhopal in special theory of relativity.\r\n2)Project work under DR:Umesh R Kadane ,Assistant professor IIST Trivandrum in Optical spectroscopy and analysing H21 line.\r\n3)Project work under DR:Rajib Saha ,Assistant professor,IISER Bhopal in CMB foreground removal methods and statistical isotropy of CMB anisotropy.

I read Physics and Mathematics with immense attention during my Higher Secondary days.\r\nIn pursuit of my dream, I completed B. Sc (Honours in Electronics) from Acharya Prafulla Chandra College, under University of Calcutta. I studied M.Sc. course in Electronic Science at same college. In my undergraduate course, I had learnt electronics, communication principles, Digital and Analog Electronics, Quantum Mechanics etc. Along with that I learnt those subject in details during M.Sc.and learnt some new courses like Microelectronics, Microwave Engineering, E.M. Theory etc.\r\nBut studying interesting facts of science which is out of conventional course always attracts me very much. M.sc project work on nano MOSFET attracted my interest towards nano electronics, that is why I took admission in Jadavpur University for the course M.Tech in Nano Science and Technology.During this course I have attended many seminars to update myself about the recent trends of research.One of them was on Radio Astronomy.Though all through I listen all the talks very minutely,but I could understand very few. Since then I watched the advancement of our research in space in Discovery channel, News papers,and Internet, now I have decided to choose this subjects for future studies. From them started to collect information the best institute of India that give opportunity to pursue P.hd in Astronomy related subject.I think this institute is the best institute in the field of astronomy.\r\nI am certain that my research interest will get a clear direction under the guidance of the distinguished teachers of your department.

As we expand our knowledge of the universe, we cannot remain without a sense of awe and amazement.\r\nThough the study of Astronomy does not seem to have a direct impact on our daily life, like say, meteorology,there are many examples where the development of technology and instruments used in the study of astronomy have become essential in our daily life.\r\nAstronomy studies are important to learn about the cycles of the sun which affect the weather and in turn life on earth, movement of comets and asteroids, the life cycles of stars.\r\nOn Earth, as we face pressures on our finite resources, we need to look for energy sources and possible habitable worlds. Advancements in astronomy can help address this issue.\r\nMy earliest interest in astronomy was whetted by science fiction stories. The science magazines like Science Reporter, National Geographic, Scientific American which I read from the local library further developed my interest. The works of Isaac Asimov and particularly Cosmos by Carl Sagan also influenced me. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams was also influenced me a lot. TV programmes on Discovery Channel and National Geographic also stimulated my interest. During my Higher Secondary School studies (XI-XII) my Physics teacher introduced me to Observational Astronomy. I have since then participated in Night Sky Observation Programmes. We did not have astronomy as a separate subject in College, but nonetheless, my interest remained. I regularly attend programmes conducted by Association of Friends of Astronomy, Goa.\r\nIn the near future, i.e. this November, I will be volunteering with a friend on his project called Astroproject, which is an initiative to develop a documentary series on Astronomy and Astrophysics studies in India. \r\nI would love to work on interstellar dust as it is instrumental in understanding various processes in the universe.','','Centre Topper at NGPE in 2011.','CSIR NET score at December 2013 exam-20%','No','Selected','No','No','2014-09-22 17:11:06'),(975,'SUKHEN MANDAL','1989-01-03','Male','INDIAN','ssukhen88@gmail.com','VILL+POST-TILABAD\r\nP.S-KUNDAHIT\r\nDIST-JAMTARA\r\nSTATE-JHARKHAND\r\nPIN-815359','815359','JAMTARA','Jharkhand','+919572294054','AT-RASIKPUR,NEAR CENTRAL BANK S.P COLLEGE ROAD DUMKA\r\nDIST-DUMKA\r\nSTATE-JHARKHAND\r\nPIN-814101','814101','DUMKA','Jharkhand','OBC','Xth Std','S.B.H.S KUNDAHIT','J.A.C RANCHI',2004,'1ST',67,'XIIth Std','S.P COLLEGE DUMKA','J.A.C RANCHI',2006,'2ND',51,'B.Sc.','S.P COLLEGE DUMKA','S.K.M.U DUMKA',2010,'1ST',80,'M.Sc.','P.G CENTRE DUMKA','S.K.M.U DUMKA',2014,'1ST',84,'M.Sc.

Early cultures identified celestial objects with the gods and took their movements across the sky as prophecies of what was to come. We would now call this astrology, far removed from the hard facts and expensive instruments of todays astronomy, but there are still hints of this history in modern astronomy. Take, for example, the names of the constellations: Andromeda, the chained maiden of Greek mythology, or Perseus, the demi-god who saved her.Now, as our understanding of the world progresses, we find ourselves and our view of the world even more entwined with the stars. The discovery that the basic elements that we find in stars, and the gas and dust around them, are the same elements that make up our bodies has further deepened the connection between us and the cosmos. This connection touches our lives, and the awe it inspires is perhaps the reason that the beautiful images astronomy provides us with are so popular in todays culture.\r\n\r\nThere are still many unanswered questions in astronomy. Current research is struggling to understand questions like: How old are we?, What is the fate of the Universe? and possibly the most interesting: How unique is the Universe, and could a slightly different Universe ever have supported life? But astronomy is also breaking new records every day, establishing the furthest distances, most massive objects, highest temperatures and most violent explosions.\r\n\r\nPursuing these questions is a fundamental part of being human, yet in today\'s world it has become increasingly important to be able to justify the pursuit of the answers. The difficulties in describing the importance of astronomy\r\nthese things attracts myself towards the Astronamy and Astrophysics.Although we live in a world faced with the many immediate problems of hunger, poverty, energy and global warming, we argue that astronomy has long term benefits that are equally as important to a civilized society. Several studies (see below) have told us that investing in science education, research and technology provides a great return  not only economically, but culturally and indirectly for the population in general  and has helped countries to face and overcome crises. The scientific and technological development of a country or region is closely linked to its human development index  a statistic that is a measure of life expectancy, education and income.In the outlined both the tangible and intangible reasons that astronomy is an important part of society.  contribution is still the fact that astronomy makes us aware of how we fit into the vast Universe. The American astronomer Carl Sagan showed us one of astronomys simplest and most inspirational contributions to society in his book, The Pale Blue Dot:\r\n\r\nIt has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human .. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the onl home weve ever known.','','','','Yes','Selected','No','No','2014-09-22 17:14:07'),(977,'Abhishek Chaturbedy','1993-07-10','Male','indian','abhishek10chaubey@gmail.com','vill &amp; post- gutwan, distt- jaunpur(u.p.)','222136','jau','Uttar Pradesh','09621416696','T.D.P.G.

This firm works to spread awareness in the field of Astronomy and Space Science. My work is in this organization is to breakdown the concepts of science and astronomy at the level of school students. I design curriculum in terms of role-plays, activities and demonstrations so that a student can relate science to his/her day-to-day life. I am a science communicator also. I deliver lectures in different schools and public workshops. \r\nDuring this entire year I worked on many different concepts of astronomy like life-cycle of stars, formation of solar system, Suns motion with respect to Earth, study of Sun, Universe in EM wavelengths, Exo-planet and Exo-life and a lot more. Along with that I also have learnt night sky orientation, Star hoping, worked on star-charts, telescope handlings etcetera.\r\nWhile working I have gone through many interesting theoretical concepts those built my interest in this field. There are many things I understand easily but many of them are quite critical so that I have to put a lot of efforts to understand. For example I worked on the Life cycle of stars. It is not as simple as a humans life. But form the birth to death two forces plays very important role i.e. Gravitational pull and Thermal pressure. These two forces lead all the major phenomenon (like size, mass, life-span etc.) of a stars. There is H-R diagram that gives the classification for a star depends on color, size, temperature, and so on. All these are very fascinating but the process of Nucleo-synthesis is very amazing for me that make my interest in Astronomy. I want to know how material heavier than Fe form during a Supernova and also about the formation of very heavy elements like uranium, radium, plutonium and so on. I want to understand these concepts and also want to work on such topics. \r\nSimilarly, the concepts of magnetic fields amazed me a lot. Everyone knows that Electric and magnetic field both are inter-linked. But, we know that everything possesses Magnetic Field but what about the electric field. Also magnetic field leads many spectacular phenomenons like Auroras, Sun-spots, Solar-prominences and flare and so on. There is the concept of magnetic field reversal also that I find complicated. Somewhere, I believe that magnetic field plays very important role to hold a star and also its Activities. I want to work on the origin of magnetic field of the celestial objects like stars and galaxies.\r\nSimilarly, EM Radiation is very vast to understand. Most of the universe speaks in the language of EM Radiation. Spectroscopy is a tool to understand this language of the universe. I have worked on visible spectrum. But I want to explore more in spectroscopy like UV, Radio etc.\r\nTo understand such concepts in depth, I need some guidance and also the opportunity to work under the people who are already working in such a field. So that, I plan to pursue Ph.D. ','I have done M. Sc. Dissertation work under the guidance of Dr. Shreyashkar Dev Singh, Scientific Officer-F, RRCAT, Indore, M.P.  \r\nWe synthesized NiO and Ni1-xZnxO polycrystalline samples by sol-gel method using Nickel acetate and Zinc acetate as precursors. We optimized the annealing temperature for obtaining NiO polycrystalline powder and also the method of making Ni1-xZnxO polycrystalline samples. The synthesized powder annealed in air at various temperatures (350oC950oC), where good crystalline quality has been achieved at 950oC. Crystal structure of the samples has been analyzed by X-ray diffraction technique. The Bragg peak corresponding to NiO shifts towards lower angle with increase in Zn composition and lattice constant increases linearly with Zn composition (x&amp;#8804; 0.25) and then it becomes constant. With further increase in Zn composition, ZnO wurtzite phase is also observed along with cubic phase of Ni1-xZnxO in the XRD data which leads to the observation of miscibility gap.','No','No','No','Rejected','No','No','2014-09-22 17:29:07'),(980,'Surabhi Sharma','1993-07-28','Female','Indian','surabhis12@gmail.com','G.F-37, Neelam Vihar, Sector-14, Kaushambi, Ghaziabad','201010','Ghaziabad','Uttar Pradesh','01202770009','Gargi College, University of Delhi, Siri Fort Road, New Delhi','110049','New Delhi','Delhi','General','Xth Std','Lady Irwin School','CBSE',2009,'',80,'XIIth Std','Lady Irwin School','CBSE',2011,'',75,'B.Sc.','Gargi College','University of Delhi',2014,'',71,'NULL','N/A','',0,'',0,'B.Sc. physical science','2014','Mr. Munish, \r\nAssistant Professor, \r\nGargi College, University of Delhi','Mr. Manish Kumar,\r\nAssistant Professor,\r\nGargi College, University of Delhi','I have completed my B.Sc. in 2014 and taken admission in M.Sc.

Astronomy is as good as Asrophysics. During the 20th century, the field of professional astronomy split into observational and theoretical branches. Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects, which is then analyzed using basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. The two fields complement each other, with theoretical astronomy seeking to explain the observational results and observations being used to confirm theoretical results.\r\nNow ISRO has sent Satellite on MARS and it will enter in Mars Orbit as on 24 Sept.2014\r\nfor study of Physical and Chemical phenomenon.\r\nAstronomy being  one of the oldest sciences seems very interesting and exciting field to me.

Compression makes it possible for creating file sizes of manageable, storable and transmittable dimensions. Image compression techniques fall under two categories i.e. lossless and lossy compression. Here, lossy compression has been implemented using wavelet techniques. Wavelets are mathematical functions that were developed for sorting the data by frequencies. Haar transform is averaging and differencing  of pixels to obtain transformed and detail coefficients.The platform used for the implementation of above algorithm is MATLAB software. The quality of the compressed images has been evaluated using some Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Square Error(MSE).','Central Govt Scholarship in B.E. and M.Tech.','GATE Score-359 for 2014','Yes','Selected','No','No','2014-09-22 18:02:07'),(992,'Debashis Talukdar','1991-11-16','Male','indian','debashistalukdar1991@gmail.com','138 fakir ghosh lane\r\nDumdum','700030','kolkata','West Bengal','9614120293','IIEST\r\nShibpur','711103','howrah','West Bengal','General','Xth Std','Chanchal Siddheswari Institution','WBBSE',2007,'',82,'XIIth Std','Chanchal Siddheswari Institution','WBCHSE',2009,'',79,'B.Sc.','S A Jaipuria College','University of Calcutta',2013,'',70,'M.Sc.','IIEST, Shibpur','IIEST',2015,'',71,'M.Sc Physics','2015','Dr. Abhijit Majumder','Dr. Syed Minhaz Hossain','','No',NULL,'Observations','Astrophysics is one of my favourite topic of physics.

Thus, I am really pretty much ignorant about many of its intricacies. Though, as a part of my academic curriculum in undergraduate and now in postgraduate course I did some basic mathematical methods of physics which involves vector and tensor analysis and their algebra and calculus, solving differential equations, linear and matrix algebra that may come useful and I also studied some thermodynamics and nuclear and atomic physics that included a bit of astrophysics as a part of it. I also attended few lecture-sessions by some putative faculties and scientists on special and general  theory of relativity, black holes, mira variable stars and few such topics in the summer-schools arranged by IACS (Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science) and IAPT(Indian Association of Physics Teachers) and SNBNCBS(S.N.

I loved to watch the stars with my friend. We spotted satellites moving about in the night sky and that made me yearn for more knowledge of these things. During school, I read about AURORAS and WHITE DWARFS and RED GIANTS, about supermassive BLACK-HOLES and this sparked my interest further. \r\nI remember during one solar eclipse, I used a negative to view the partial ring. The phenomena of space are astounding and have boggle my mind for a long time. All through junior college, I would read about the cosmos, about stars and galaxies. In college, I chose the closest branch of engineering to space that I could i.e. Aeronautical Engineering. Even so, my appetite for space was never satisfied. I read as much as I could, including magazines and blogs, whatever I could lay my hands upon.\r\nI made a Newtonian telescope in school for a science fair, although it didnt really help to see stars as it was more of a geographical telescope than an astronomical one. I was simply awed when I visited the Nehru Planetarium in Mumbai for the first time.  I have looked up to the likes of CV Raman, and someday I hope to contribute as much to astronomy as they did. Hence I wish to study and further satiate my thirst for, and hopefully understand more about the infinities of space and be a part of something bigger.\r\n','','','','No','Rejected','No','No','2014-09-22 20:14:18'),(1020,'thamira chakradhar ','1993-06-25','Male','indian','chakradharchakri20@gmail.com','Thamira chakradhar\r\nS/O Thamira lakshmana srinivasa rao\r\nD.NO 33-12-14 New Bank Colony Road\r\nAcchugatlapalem,PALAKOL,WEST GODAVARI DISTRT,ANDHARPRADESH.\r\nPIN 534260','534260','Hyderabad','Andhra Pradesh','08814224834','Thamira chakradhar\r\nS/O Thamira lakshmana srinivasa rao\r\nD.NO 33-12-14 New Bank Colony Road\r\nAcchugatlapalem,PALAKOL,WEST GODAVARI DISTRT,ANDHARPRADESH.\r\nPIN 534260','534260','Hyderabad','Andhra Pradesh','OBC','Xth Std','S.K.P AND T.V.R.M.H.SCHOOL IN PALAKOL','SSC',2008,'A',66,'XIIth Std','NARAYANA Jr.COLLEGE IN RAJAHMUNDRY','BOI',2010,'A',70,'B.Sc.','ADITYA DEGREE COLLEGE IN PALAKOL','ANDHRA UNIVERSITY ',2013,'A ',70,'NULL','','',0,'',0,'B.Sc CHEMISTRY','2013','A.VENKATESWARA RAO \r\nLect.MATHS (M.Sc B.Ed)','S.SUBRAMANYAM \r\nLect.COMPUTER SCIENCE(M.Sc)\r\n','NO','No',NULL,'Theory, Observations, Computation','THE MAJOR ACTION OF SUN ON PLANETS AND ON ITS MOTION,AND STUDY OF SATELLITES TO DEVELOP THE COMMUNICATION.','NO','YES\r\nI GOT  3rd RANK IN RAMANUJAN TALENT TEST \r\nI HAVE MANY PRIZES IN DEBEAT COMPITATION UNDER MY SCHOOL STUDIES.','STILL DON NOT ATTEMPT ','No','Rejected','No','No','2014-09-22 20:14:36'),(1021,'MANAS KUMAR MOHAPATRA','1993-04-15','Male','INDIAN','manasmohapatra12@gmail.com','mh-d,room no-510,university of hyderabad,gachhibowli,hyderabad','500046','Hyderabad','Andhra Pradesh','918332909543','mh-d,room no-510,university of hyderabad,gachhibowli,hyderabad','500046','Hyderabad','Andhra Pradesh','OBC','Xth Std','GOPINATH DEV BIDYAPITH,PADMABATI','BSE,ORISSA',2008,'FIRST',80,'XIIth Std','NAYAGARH JUNIOR COLLEGE,NAYAGARH','CHSE ORISSA',2010,'FIRST',79,'B.Sc.','RAVENSHAW UNIVERSITY,CUTTACK','RAVENSHAW UNIVERSITY,O',2013,'FIRST',74,'M.Sc.','UNIVERSITY OF HYDERABAD','UNIVERSITYOF HYDERABAD',2015,'FIRST',69,'B.SC','2013','PROF.

This news was continuously flashing on every news channel and every single newspaper was telling about it which developed my curiosity about the Astronomy and the whole incident attracted me towards the field of Astronomy. The attraction was so strong that I insisted to paint the wall of my room by Stars, Planets and Spacecraft. Since then I started gathering the kwowledge about planets and stars. The first book I read which is the most basic book for Astronomy was \"Aakashashi Jadle Nate\" by Dr. Jayant Naralikar and since then I really got fascinated about the space. Then I started reading more and more books related to the space.\r\n       For making the base of Physics and Mathematics strong, I gave many competitive exams at school level. At that time the project \"Large Hadron Collider\" created a great impact on me and inspired me to pursue the field of Astronomy. Since then I have started attending Sky-observation programmes. To pursue Astronomy and Astrophysics in my higher education, I chose to do graduation in Physics. I am regularly attending the lectures related to science at Nehru Planetarium. Now when I am getting to know more and more about Astronomy and Astrophysics, the theories like parallel universe, birth of universe and projects like Large Hadron Collider are fascinating me. \r\n       Also I am curious about Radio Astronomy since I visited Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) situated at Narayangaon. Few months before, I have attended RAD@home Discovery Camp held at UM-DAE, CBS, Mumbai in which I have actually analysed and charecterised the images of Radio Galexies taken from GMRT. This experience motivated me to pursue Astronomy and Astrophysics in my higher education.\r\n       I would like to continue my goal, if i get selected at IUCAA for integrated Ph.D. course. By gaining Master degree in Astronomy and Astrophysics, I will attain the proper skills to perform the job of an Astrophysicist. Finally, aftre receiving Ph.D., I would like to do research in the field of Astronomy and Astrophysics and conduct research projects which will assist in the growing field of Astronomy.','','','','No','Rejected','No','No','2014-09-22 20:21:16'),(1026,'BALU R WARIER','1992-03-18','Male','INDIAN','brbal9@gmail.com','JYOTHIS PUTHENMADOM\r\nCHEERANCHIRA P.O.\r\nCHANGANACHERRY','686106','KOTTAYAM','Kerala','919446097286','KURIAKOSE ELIAS COLLEGE\r\nMANNANAM\r\nKOTTAYAM','686561','KOTTAYAM','Kerala','General','Xth Std','LOURDES PUBLIC SCHOOL ','CBSE',2008,'',73,'XIIth Std','LOURDES PUBLIC SCHOOL','CBSE',2010,'',65,'B.Sc.','PHYSICS ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE','M.G.

And is there exist any process to count the \"Black hole\" in a certain interval  of time?

The concept of stars ,planets ,solar system  and the whole universe delighted me very much .One thing as human have never been able to fully understand is astronomy . It has  always been an unexplained mystery . Astronomy also as served as way to keep time and predict the future . The world astronomy is defined as the study of heavenly bodies , meaning anything in the sky such as stars , galaxies , comets ,planets , nebulae and so on .Astronomy has always been source to the people who have looked to the universe to determine physical location gain spiritual direction and to track time . Many early scientists used astronomy to make careers for themselves and print there names in all the history books of time.\r\nMy main aim is to use the concept of quantum optics and entanglement in astrophysics and astronomy. Quantum optics is the study of interaction of light with matter. Entanglement is a unique feature of Quantum mechanics that can be created between different objects such as individual photons, atoms, nuclear spins and even between biological living cells. Entanglement occurs when two sub-atomic particles are somehow connected or entangled with one particle, the same thing simultaneously happens to the other particles, even if its miles away. The principle of quantum superposition states that if a physical system may in one of many configurations-arrangements of particles or fields then the most general state is a combination of all of these possibilities, where the amount in each configuration is specified by a complex number. My idea is to create entanglement between all the planets of our solar system, so that we can observe the changes  in conditions of other planets from earth . There is some interaction between the planets of our solar system so it means we can create entanglement as there is superposition of particles of planets. This same principle can be used to create entanglement between earth and dark matter, so that we can explore more about dark matter. We can send light to interact with particles of dark matter as well, as planets to know more about them. So with your useful guidance hopefully  I can achieve my goal.\r\n','YES.I did internship on the  Topic-NETWORKING(Setting up a small network)','MADRAS UNIVERSITY MERIT SCHOLARSHIP,MADRAS UNIVERSITY,CHENNAI.','','No','Waiting','No','No','2014-09-22 20:33:28'),(1032,'parvathy harikumar ','1992-08-11','Female','INDIAN','parvathyh92@gmail.com','ROOM#227\r\nAVVAI HOSTEL FOR WOMEN\r\nUNIVERSITY OF MADRAS\r\nGUINDY CAMPUS','600025','Chennai','Tamil Nadu','04422202830','ROOM#227\r\nAVVAI HOSTEL FOR WOMEN\r\nUNIVERSITY OF MADRAS\r\nGUINDY CAMPUS','600025','Chennai','Tamil Nadu','General','Xth Std','BHARATIYA VIDYA BHAVAN','CBSE',2008,'A+',87,'XIIth Std','BHARATIYA VIDYA BHAVAN','CBSE',2010,'A',79,'B.Sc.','MADRAS CHRISTIAN COLLEGE ','MADRAS UNIVERSITY',2013,'',80,'M.Sc.','MADRAS UNIVERSITY','MADRAS UNIVERSITY',0,'',0,'M.SC.PHYSICS','2015','DR.RITA JOHN\r\nASSISTANT PROFESSOR\r\nDEPT.

By the time she gets accustomed to it she will be brought into the world where there is light and life. Everything surrounding her would look strange to her at once but slowly through broken words and gestures she conveys her feelings and tries to know more about her second bigger brighter home from her mother. That is how my story began too. Like any other child I was also curious to know everything is the way it is! Like the color of the sky, the sunrise, the sunset, the wind, the rain and of course the twinkling little stars! For those questions that my mom could not answer I found answers in my school textbooks and for those unanswered by them I went in search of magazines and Science fictions. One of the earliest books I read was ?The brief history of time? by Stephen Hawking. It took me through more and more wonders of the universe like the black holes and the dark matter, the unsolved mysteries that run 24x7 on the giant minds. When everyone wanted to an Engineer or a Doctor, I realized my future lies in Physics because it will always fascinate me how much ever old I get or Physics gets. With my interests deeply rooted in Astrophysics I decided to take up Physics as my career because I was not in a hurry to make money instead I wanted to be a part of that community who finds out an answer to the questions asked by people  like me out of curiosity. The more closer I got to the subject more convincing became the reasons behind.  I might not have exposed myself to all the research work going on in the field of Astrophysics other than the news that pops up now and then but I have this never ending passion to know how everything came into being. If we solve the mysteries like the dark matter which accounts for almost 98% of the whole universe and the heat death paradox, we can know what brought us here and what awaits us.  ?Beyond Einstein? and ?Parallel worlds? by Michio Kaku are the two books I don?t feel like putting down and I would put my heart and soul into understanding the night sky paradox, String theory and more. Of all the dreams in my garden of dreams the only one I have been nourishing and nurturing is the dream of becoming as Astrophysicist and I believe everything else will follow and of course Physics is immortal as long as there is a mind to put forward a what, why and a how!

Though the universe borne billions of years back, it is possible today to get huge amount of information about the primordial eras as well. I had a good chance to lean about the Standard Cosmology and about the physical processes through which our universe had to pass through. While introducing cosmological models for the better theoretical understanding of stories beyond the horizon, Inflationary models came into the picture. I was really surprised by seeing how beautifully this model solves the problems found in standard cosmology. But that was not an end.

Since my high school I was astonished by the way the distinct changes that were happening around me, whether it was formation of a rainbow, the weather changes, black holes, lunar eclipse and solar eclipse. Being an average student at my starting years of graduation I was not interested in Physics, but one thing that caught my eye at that time was relativity. I was astonished by the fact that how mass, time and length differs from the original value if one is moved with the speed of light. With this interest I read more work on this topic but never had an opportunity to work on this field.\r\n\r\nBeing attracted towards experimental and observation more than theoretical knowledge, I believe more knowledge is gained while doing experiments. With this thought I use to go to the terrace and see the changes in pattern of celestial bodies and note down the same. Being an amateur, I have observed some so called constellations defined by me and have observed that they repeat their pattern everyday.\r\n\r\nWith my master study, I realized that what I have learned so far has left me with yet another set of questions I can only pursue in an academic setting. Hence, I hope to be granted the opportunity to explore new possibilities while pursuing a PhD degree in Astrophysics at a reputed institute in the country.The NCRA-TIFR Test is a step towards my long term goal of establishing myself as a successful researcher in this field. Essentially, it will equip me with the crucial theoretical and practical foundation to successfully conduct research, struggle with complex issues in an intricate web of scientific thoughts and reach conclusions that are necessary for formulating new working explanations and make new discoveries.','The following projects have been carried out:\r\n1: Currently working on Nano structures and their Gas sensing properties as my final year M.Sc project under the supervision of Dr. Rupali Nagar(S.I.T).\r\n2: Worked on the Raman Spectroscopy of a specimen under A.c and D.c magnetic magnetic field under the supervision of Prof. K.Sreenivasan(D.U), 2012-2013.\r\n3: Worked on the filtration of different waves using Fourier Transform under the supervision of Dr. A.K Arora and Dr. Divya Haridas as my final year project for my undergraduate program.','The following Awards/Scholarship were received:\r\n1: Presented a paper on \"Fuel Cells as Future Power Devices\" at STUCON 14, organized by S.I.T, Pune and the paper was adjudged 2nd best paper in the conference.\r\n2: Awarded IIIrd position in the college during B.Sc(H) Physics, 2010-2011.\r\n3: Awarded Certificate of Merit by C.B.S.E for being the top 0.1% of successful candidates of A.I.S.S.E in Science and Technology, 2006-2007.\r\n4: Awarded proficiency in Science by B.B.P.S, Pitampura for the academic year 2006-2007.\r\n5: Awarded certificate of Merit for outstanding performance  in Scholastic and Non-Scholastic subjects by B.B.PS, Pitampura for the academic year 2006-2007.','','Yes','Selected','No','No','2014-09-22 21:03:59'),(1045,'Himanshu Shukla','1990-03-08','Male','Indian','himanshufuny@gmail.com','Hno. 135/gha, Behind satya sai temple, Dadabadi colony, Ramaiyya Ward, Motitalab para, Jagdalpur (494001), Bastar Chhattisgarh','494001','Jagdalpur','Chhattisgarh','919099284259','National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal.\r\nSrinivasanagar, Mangalore\r\nKarnataka','575025','mangalore','Karnataka','General','Xth Std','Nirmal Vidyalaya, Jagdalpur, Chhattisgarh','ICSE',2006,'first',72,'XIIth Std','Lady Anusuya Singhania Educational Academy, Jhalawar, Rajasthan','CBSE',2008,'first',72,'B.Tech.','National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal','NITK Surathkal',2014,'first',75,'NULL','NA','NA',0,'NA',0,'B.

It was then, when my interest in physics sprouted. Unable to grasp the complexity of language in which I heard the great physicists talking, I got curious to understand what is actually going on. My love of mathematics drove me more towards theoretical physics. In my second year it almost became my pass-time to watch the online lectures of Dr. Leonard Susskind and physics lectures from NPTEL. I attended a lecture on String theory delivered by Dr. Siraj Minwala from TIFR and his enthusiasm for physics left me dazzled. I took up available courses on physics and mathematics like General Theory of Relativity, Advanced Quantum Mechanics, mathematical Physics, Numerical Methods etc. It was however hard to manage between both the departments so I ended up with average scores in physics courses. I never did mind it because I was just doing it for the love of learning and not for the sake of polishing my resume. At that time I had not thought of taking up physics as my career. I could not apply for summer internships because in mining engineering it is mandatory to complete an industrial training after every semester. I attended a workshop on Astrophysics and astronomy provided by Indian Academy of Sciences which got me interested into Astrophysics. The tales of how hard working, diligent and meticulous was Dr. S. Chandrasekhar, were motivating. I also attended several other lectures now and then in NITK. I love mathematics, applied mathematics to be precise. To express a physical situation in equations  and to play with them and get to wonderful places in cognition. I have also seen in myself an elixir of curiosity about everything. As I am growing up I am understanding the importance of self discipline and its efficacy in conjunction with curiosity.\r\nI worked for an MNC for two months, could not resist and quit it to pursue modern physics, preferably in astrophysics. Currently I try to understand as much as can on my own.

This was the prime reason i decided to pursue Astrophysics as my career. Physics is the tool for understanding Why and How things happen and work. This ignited my passion to work in science and to narrow it down to Astronomy and Astrophysics. It has continued with trying to find answers to the questions that arise from reading and attending lectures at nehru planetarium and using my own understanding about a particular phenomena or any subject to try and figure out whether the proposed answer is agreeable to my understanding about the subject. And in cases where i do not agree to the given answer it always leads to challenging discussions on that topic with my friends and professors. My inquisitiveness has always made me ask a lot of questions which helps me a lot in understanding and strengthening my concepts better. And discussions with astronomy enthusiasts and teachers at astronomy clubs has helped me in enriching my knowledge in this subject which further captivates me in my quest for cosmos. this further deepens my love and want for astronomy and astrophysics as my journey. Understanding the basic physics is the only impetus to understanding physics behind astronomy and i have always tried to grow in physics in order to be able to understand astrophysics better.

I started looking at the pictures in astronomy books before I could even read. The pictures were beautiful,fascinating and intriguing. As I grew up I wanted to know all about what those pictures meant.I am still learning. Perhaps i like astronomy because we are personally a way of the Universe experiencing itself,or that we are all made of star-stuff,as Carl Sagan so elegantly put it. Astronomy is a science that seeks to explain everything that we observe in the Universe,from the comets and planets in our own solar system to distant galaxies to the echoes of the Big Bang. By studying the cosmos beyond our own planet,we can understand where we came from,where we are going,why is the universe organized as it is?Are we alone? And how physics works under conditions which are impossible to recreate on Earth. In astronomy,the Universe is our laboratory! Astronomy provides an example of an alternative approach to the scientific method- observation,simulation,and theory. It is an enjoyable,inexpensive hobby for millions of people- the naturalists of the night. But above all astronomy has shown us how insignificant the human physical existence is,and how great the human mind with an intelligence that is now embracing a dazzling range of phenomena,from the astronomically large to the infinitely small. I have very little doubt that what astronomy will still give us in the future will dwarf all of its past contributions by comparison. I am motivated by curiosity and a deep desire to understand some of the grandest and most beautiful phenomena in the universe,as well as a desire to share these wonders with others. To me, research is often a bridge to an ambitious goal - a bridge that needs to be crossed in steps. Astrophysics strike me as one of the most exciting areas of research today. Thanks to new observations,better methods and more powerful simulations that we can now hope to answer,with reasonable confidence,some of the most profound questions ever raised.Astronomy has emerged forever from the old books of mythology to assert itself as an exact science,an unclouded crystal ball of the universe. I would like to be a part of it.

Sky gazing is the first thing that develops our interest in the field of Astronomy. The mysteries of the universe have always ignited curiosity in my mind.  Astronomy confronts us with some of the biggest and most challenging problems about the nature of ourselves and about the reality. I am curious to know answers to questions like why life is possible only on planet earth, or is it possible somewhere else also, how life originated on earth, what will be the ultimate fate of life on earth, etc. These mysteries can be solved if we look deep into the universe. When we look into space, at any star, we are looking into history. By understanding what is out there, we can understand what is down here. Knowing the possible causes of origin of life on earth ,the fate of life on earth can then be predicted. \r\nI want to explore the field of astronomy and astrophysics and get answers to such questions. \r\nTo put a step further towards my goal, I had done some internships. It helped me in gaining radical insight into this field. I enjoyed working in this field and exploring things. I realized that I love analyzing and interpreting data. The more I study about the universe, the more I want to know further. \r\nI once got a chance to see the sky using telescope. The observation amazed me. Now I am highly motivated to do research in this field and pursue it as my career.\r\nI keep on attending some seminars or talks related to astronomy and astrophysics. Such seminars provides me with information about the possible research areas in this field. I am passionate to solve the mysteries of the universe. As of now, I have got interest in sub-areas like observational astronomy, planetary sciences, knowing about the atmospheres of various planets , gravitational lensing, etc. Reading articles on the researches going on in this field and the telescopic observations also keeps me updated with this field. It motivates me to work in this area of research. The internships done by me have further enhanced my interest. I found immense pleasure in exploring this field.But most importantly, I love astronomy because it is hard and challenging, but always rewarding.\r\nSo I am looking forward to do PhD in astronomy and astrophysics. \r\n','I have carried out a project titled  - Study of Lunar Atmospheric Composition using CHACE measurements and Laboratory Simulations, at Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad. The data taken by an instrument called CHACE, onboard Chandrayaan-1 mission of India, was analysed. The presence of carbon dioxide in lunar atmosphere was being confirmed using the data. An experiment was also carried out. The conditions prevailing on Moon were simulated in the laboratory. Electrons were irradiated on ices of carbon dioxide and carbon disulphide, both of which are confirmed to be present on Moon, and the products were observed. The results were analysed.\r\nApart from it, I have also done summer research fellowship under Indian Academy of Science (IAS) on the topic - General Theory of Relativity and an Introduction to Cosmology. I studied about General Theory of Relativity and how it can be applied to understand cosmology.

I am more interested to do Observational and analytical work. These connections to the subject of astronomy enabled me to survey the field of Astronomy in a broad sense and therefore I wish to pursue doctoral research in the field of Astronomy or astrophysics in general and in some of the specific research topics in particular as listed following.\r\n\r\n	Solar System and Its Evolution\r\n	Effect of Solar Radiation and charged Particles on human life on other Planets\r\n	Star Formation and its Evolution\r\n\r\nThroughout our milky way Galaxy and many other galaxies, new generations of stars are continually being born and old generations are dying. Studying the earliest dust-enshrouded phases of star and planet formation is the exclusive domain of radio astronomy. I want to study how stars and planets formed over different environmental and initial conditions. To solve this scientific problem, I want to analyze radio and infrared observations which can be a best scientific approach because now a days multi wavelength approach is essential to understand fundamental science. \r\nI understand that these topics design the frontiers of current research and I have research experience in Solar Physics. There are several state-of-the-art tools and computational facilities to investigate these topics. I feel comfortable with fundamentals of electrodynamics and therefore, confident that I will be able to quickly learn its advanced applications in the chosen field of research and make significant contributions\r\n','I have worked as a Project associate in Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics Division, PRL Ahmedabad from June 2012 to 2013.

I loved when people talked about stars and galaxies, etc. But as I grew, I started to learn that astronomy and astrophysics is not just about stars and galaxies, there is so much mathematics hidden in it. And the deeper I got, the more was I interested.\r\nWhen I came to pune for graduation, I started to attend the lectures on astronomy or astrophysics whenever I got chance. Most of them were held at IUCAA. The recent one was on the 30 meter telescope that is to be built in the next 10 years. When built, it will be the worlds largest telescope. It is the project by 5 countries including India and United States of America with IUCAA representing India. With such telescope, our ideas about our universe are going to change drastically. Whenever we discover new, we get new dimensions of thinking, and that is where I want to be.\r\n\r\nWhen we study our history, we will see that from ancient times we have been fond of astronomical things. The great personalities like Aryabhatta, Bhaskaracharya have contributed to this field so much. We have a very rich culture and history, and astronomy was a big part of it. And as the culture is followed through generations, we are now one of the  leading countries which have so much research ongoing in astronomy and astrophysics. And it will be my privilege if I can contribute to it. All I have ever dreamed is to do something good for the mankind. And if I get the chance by doing it through my favorite subject, then that will be the best opportunity for me.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in high school, I used to watch sky and by using star manuals I used to observe the stars with my simple binoculars. I started to identify the constellations. Most of them. I was very curious about them. Why they twinkle? Why do they have different colors? etc. questions were in my mind. And as I continued to study and observe the stars I found the answers. But, my curiosity was not satisfied. I was eager for more. When I got chance, I watched eclipses from telescopes. Our solar system, our galaxy, our universe, these terms are always moving in my mind. They keep mi curious, which keeps you moving ahead.\r\n\r\nI am doing TYBSc Physics right now, and if I get chance to do research in such institutes, I am confident that I will be very useful for the wellness of our mankind, of nature, of our country.

These innovations become the useful tools in discovering the universe and also in inventions of telescopes and spaceships. Although we have focussed on technology and knowledge transfer perhaps the most important contribution is still the fact that astrophysics makes us aware of how we fit into the vast universe. I am interested in astrophysics because of the fact that astrophysics includes theory as well as observational physics.Most wide areas of study in astrophysics, which are of immense interest to me, include the attempts to determine: the properties of dark matter, dark energy, and black holes, whether or not time travel is possible,warmholes can form, or the multiverse exists, and the origin and ultimate fate of universe.Other areas in astrophysics include:solar system formation and evolution, stellar evolution, galaxy formation and evolution, large scale structure of matter in the universe, origin of cosmic rays, including string cosmology. These aspects of study under astrophysics is my personal interest as it includes theoretical, observational and computational approach. Spectroscopy has the major role to play in astrophysics.The majority of astronomical observations are made using electromagnetic spectrum.Observational astrophysics include radio astronomy,infrared astronomy,optical astronomy,ultraviolet astronomy,X-ray and Gamma ray astronomy. In theoretical astrophysics, astrophysicists create models to develop useful formulas to compute distances of heavenly bodies, their densities, temperatures and luminosity.Telescopes have become a connecter between us and heavenly objects which are used in observing stars,planets,predicting the movement of heavenly bodies.In all we can conclude that astrophysics has been a cornerstone of technological progress throughout the history, and has much to contribute in future to give us the basic sense of our place in an unimaginably vast and exciting universe.','','','','No','Rejected','No','No','2014-09-22 23:13:48'),(1087,'GOWTHAMAN.I','1994-12-26','Male','indian','gowthaman.physics@gmail.com','gowthaman.i\r\ns\\o.p.ilangoven,\r\nyathevapuram,\r\nthethakudi south(po),\r\nvedaraniam(tk),\r\nnakappatinam(Dt).','614809','Vedaranyam','Tamil Nadu','09597212917','gowthaman.i\r\nIII B.Sc Physics,\r\njamal mohamed college,\r\nTiruchirappalli.','620020','Tiruchirappalli','Tamil Nadu','OBC','Xth Std','Govt.High school,Thopputthurai.','state board',2010,'A',90,'XIIth Std','Rn.govt.higher sec. school,ayakkaranpulam.','state board',2012,'B',70,'B.Sc.','Jamal mohamed college,Tiruchirappalli.','Barathidasan',2014,'A',75,'NULL','','',0,'',0,'III.B.Sc Physics','2015','Mr.J.Umar Malik,\r\nAssistant Professor,\r\nDepartment of Physics,\r\nJamal Mohamed College,\r\nTiruchirappalli.','Mr.A.Abbas Manthiri,\r\nAssistant Professor,\r\nDepartment of Physics,\r\nJamal Mohamed College,\r\nTiruchirappalli.','','No',NULL,'Theory, Observations, Computation','I am studied in third standard.At the time my science teacher the class in Rockets ,Planets , Sun,Stars and many more details of the space.I do not forgot that class.That is change in my life.\r\n So, i that day to daily watching the sky and imagine is help of developing\r\nin my knowledge to astronomy.And in my college days i go to the anna science planetarium .The planetarium is conducted by every month second saturday sky watching.So i use of this opportunity every month .                                                              \r\n      So i most interest the astrophysics and i love the astronomy.....\r\n   \r\n   \r\n','','','','No','Rejected','No','No','2014-09-22 23:14:18'),(1088,'Shaurya Gupta','1993-06-18','Male','Indian','shaurya_gupta@india.com','C/O Adithi, MB-79 Master Block 2nd Floor, Shakarpur','110092','New Delhi','Delhi','8595325750','Dyal Singh College, Lodhi Road, Near JLN Stadium','110003','New Delhi','Delhi','OBC','Xth Std','Christ Church Diocesan School','C.B.S.E.',2010,'9.6',91,'XIIth Std','CENTRAL HINDU BOYS SCHOOL, B.H.U.','C.B.S.E.',2012,'',75,'B.Sc.','DYAL SINGH COLLEGE','UNIVERSITY OF DELHI',2015,'',76,'NULL','','',0,'',0,'B.Sc.

With the passage of time the knowledge of Trojan and asteroids with potential to harm the earth even made me close to the subject. With the Space &amp; Research organisation of India adds more enthusiasm in every Indian to be a part of the discoveries and success. \r\nThe Geomagnetically induced Currents(GICs) produced by the sudden disturbance in the Earths Magnetic Field(Magnetosphere) by the Suns magnetic field produced by coronal mass ejection was presented by me in college department fest on January 16 &amp; January 18th, 2013 much before it was in the news later this year which made me more curious when i saw them in five of the astronomical &amp; science magazines on internet. Though the impact of such GICs is not effective in India as it falls in the southern hemisphere of the earth and only few coronal mass ejections are directed towards the earth as the earth acts like a point mass(Very small) revolving around the sun. \r\nAll these ideas associated with astrophysics fills me with energy to pursue it as a career.','All India Asteroid Search Campaign in collaboration with International Astronomical Search Collaboration(IASC) \r\nProject collaborators:\r\nHardin-Simmons University USA\r\nAstronomical Research Institute(ARI), Illinios, USA ','First position in Paper presentation organised by Physics Department, Hindu College, University of Delhi.\r\nFirst position in C++ Debugging organised by Physics Department, Hindu College, University of Delhi.','','No','Rejected','No','No','2014-09-22 23:16:43'),(1089,'SOUMEN DE KARMAKAR','1992-01-04','Male','INDIAN','soumendekarmakar@gmail.com','GOBINDANAGAR HOUSING SITE-C,QR.NO.-C/15,BANKURA','722102','Bankura','West Bengal','9932398650','30,MOTHER TERESA SARANI,KOLKATA','700016','Kolkata','West Bengal','OBC','Xth Std','KENDUADIHI HIGH SCHOOL','WBBSE',2008,'',88,'XIIth Std','KENDUADIHI HIGH SCHOOL','WBCHSE',2010,'A+',81,'B.Sc.','BANKURA SAMMILANI COLLEGE','BURDWAN UNIVERSITY',2013,'',66,'M.Sc.','SAINT XAVIERS COLLEGE','UNIVERSITY OF CALCUTTA',2015,'',69,'M.Sc.

It made me to be curious about stars, moon and to find out whats out there in free space.\r\n\r\nDuring my under graduation I had no Astrophysics course until fourth year. But, in my third year we were introduced to General Relativity, the knowledge of which is necessary in the Astrophysics field. So, I did a project at the end of my third year under T.R. Seshadri, on Modified Action Integral of Inflationary Universe. During this I gained firm grip on the basics of General Relativity and Its uses and applications in Astrophysics.\r\n\r\nIn my fourth year I had course on Astrophysics and Cosmology by Dr Somnath Bharadwaj of IIT-KGP. In the course we were introduced to stellar evolution, radiation transfer, CMBR, big bang and various other cosmological models etc The course was really fascinating and increased my interest and curiosity in the subject.   \r\n\r\nI was selected for VSRP 2014 programme of TIFR. I worked on Gravitational lensing in Schwarzschild and Kerr space-time. The computations involved in the project were computationally challenging and give me an insight of the mathematical and computational difficulties that one faces in advanced research.  I computationally solved the problem using matlab and mathematica by which I gained computational skills.\r\nI am doing my Msc. Project on Chameleon gravity on Galaxy clusters along with this I am also doing a project on Large Scale Structure under Dr Somnath Bharadwaj.\r\n\r\nI think all these projects and courses have nurtured my interest in Astrophysics and Astronomy.

Seshadri of University of Delhi. \r\nBrief summary of project: In standard cosmological model universe underwent an accelerated expansion in its early phase. This is usually explained by using a scalar field but in my project I produced such a rapid power law of expansion through modification of gravity action.\r\nIn my 4th year I was selected for VSRP programme of TIFR.

Two projects during my bachelors and during master program pushed me little far than previous time to understand some concepts of astrophysics which thrilled me and attracted me more towards this subject. While I was during my literature survey for my thesis ( Still writing) I came to few hard concepts as it involved carriers and future transportation. During this time I was going deeper into theory of relativity and lorentz mass difference, these two concepts though studied in younger age gave me new horizon as well new hope towards this stream. As mentioned earlier, since I am working in future hypersonics , I channeled myself into future avionics and their principles intrigued me. Made me to know more about the stuff. Apart from my projects recent events like dis proving Hawking theory on black holes and few other breakthrough in the stream made to learn more about the stuff. As the saying goes the more deeper you go, the more you get fond of it. As simple as that I started devoting time for this stream more than rest of the usual streams in physics.

The whole phenomenon which is happening around me in the nature which I can see is just a bit of an infinite illusion around me. It took billions of years for a man to understand just this bit of nature around him. Imagine how much time it takes for him to understand the whole universe. But due to a tremendous growth in the technology our efforts would add up as a drop to an ocean amount of effort needed to overcome this universe. The celestial bodies looking to be lying calmly high above us in the sky needs a lot of science to understand them. A great expertise along with an everlasting zeal would take us towards the treasure of science underlying the behaviour of these celestial bodies. My interest in physics has led me to make a valuable thought process about the galaxies, the stars, their movement, the planets and the satellites around them. When I relate the things happening in the universe with the scientific principles it creates a feeling that the scientists in the past have contributed a lot in understanding the universe and it is the responsibility on shoulders of the younger generation to continue this scientific journey towards the zenith. As a young engineer I always wonder how I can contribute myself to this great adventure. With a good grip in academics and self motive interest in physics and astronomy, I would like to apply my engineering skills in finding the shorter routes of this journey. I always think deeply about the concepts of sun, planets, their revolution and take interest in them. The younger generation who always wonder about the secrets of nature and universe should take a step towards understanding the nature. I really wanted to dig out how this universe is in a balanced state without collapsing. Thus these thoughts give me a constant inspiration towards learning astronomy. Study of nature is nothing but correlating the existing principles with the observed behaviour of celestial bodies often and formation of new scientific principles seldom.

In the last few years, I have introduced myself to the primary literature in astrophysics, especially from an evolutionary, observational and a phenomenological perspective.\r\n\r\nMy personal interest lies in understanding the origin of the universe, how it started and came into being. According to the most widely accepted theory for the origin of the universe, i.e. the Big Bang theory, we know that our universe started from an infinitely dense singularity, which underwent a cosmic inflation to give us, in due course of time, the universe as we see it today. But I am intrigued by the nature of the singularity, mainly because it cannot be explained by the classical theory of General Relativity and all the Laws of Physics break down there. On trying to incorporate Quantum theory to understand the beginning of the universe, we are led to many alternative theories, like the Big Bounce theory, resulting from Loop Quantum Gravity in which quantum fluctuations cause the Universe to expand, or the theory provided by M-theory, that suggests the fascinating idea of our universe being one of the many in multiverse. Both of these theories give us some headway into understanding that aspect of the universe where the established classical theories fail, and thus they appeal a lot to me. Though we know that the Big Bang suggests that time began at the first instant of the Big Bang, and that it has no meaning at singularity, I know that there are certain theories that still suggest that there was a time before the initial \"Bang\". These theories suggest a sparse and weakly interacting universe, that eventually led to a sudden alteration similar to the Big Bang. The idea of getting a glimpse into what was there even before the Big Bang, captivates me. String theory proposes the pre-Big Bang theory, while collision of D-branes give way to the Eukaryoptic model.\r\n\r\nOne of the most stimulating experiences that spurred my interest in the origin of universe, were the lectures given by Dr Roger Penrose on the theory of black-holes and light-cones in my institute and in IUCAA when I was in my first year. In my 3rd year, I attended a lecture series on general relativity and black holes by Prof. Soumitra Sengupta, HOD Theoretical Physics, IACS, Kolkata, which I found to be fairly comprehensive and which helped me develop a strong foundation in GR. I also attended the BITS-IUCAA Workshop on Gravitational Waves Data Analysis held in BITS Pilani, Goa campus in December 2012. I have been attending most of the Astro-club talks held in my institute (IISER, Pune) and find them very interesting and stimulating.','In my IAS SRF project that I did in summer 2012, I worked for 2 months on AGNs and the spectral properties of Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars. We used spectra obtained from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (DR 8) of 33 FSRQS, fitted those spectra for the different elements possibly emitting the radiations and derived certain properties of the FSRQs from them.\r\n\r\nIn my 3rd year, I worked on Hawking radiation and spontaneous particle creation by black-holes, for which I mainly read from Carroll, and Birrel and Davies(1982).\r\n\r\nI am currently working on flat directions in higher dimensional Supergravity theories with Dr Nabamita Banerjee. We are trying to study what happens to flat directions in six-dimensional type IIB supergravity theory.\r\n\r\nI did a winter project under Dr. Prasad Subramanian on basic astrophysical concepts in 2011.\r\n\r\nIn my 5th semester I did a reading project on the Special theory of relativity under Dr Sudarshan Ananth.','Won 1st prize in Inter-School Science Symposium on Nanotechnology in 12th std.;\r\nWon 1st prize in Science Exhibition in 9th std;\r\nWon award in \"Pace in Space with Nehru Planetarium\" Quiz and essay writing competition in 7th std.','','Yes','Selected','No','No','2014-09-22 23:59:18'),(1104,'Geethu Prabhakar','1991-05-03','Female','Indian','geethuprabhakar3@gmail.com','Thumbrathukudiyil House,\r\nThrikkariyoor P.O.,\r\nKothamangalam','686692','Kothamangalam','Kerala','9400952299','School of Pure and Applied Physics, \r\nMahatma Gandhi University,\r\nKottayam','686560','Kottayam','Kerala','OBC','Xth Std','St.Augustines Girls HSS, Kothamangalam','Kerala Board of Exam',2006,'A+',92,'XIIth Std','St.Augustines Girls HSS, Kothamangalam','HSE Board,Kerala',2008,'A+',90,'B.Sc.','Mar Athanasius College, Kothamangalam','MG University,Kottayam',2012,'B+',85,'M.Sc.','Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam','MG University,Kottayam',2014,'',72,'M.Sc.

We form a students discussion form and conduct classes and discussions by ourselves. Thus we started to enter the big world of cosmology.As we learn more it becomes more and more interesting.Our teachers are also very supportive.I did a project on cosmology also.\r\n\r\n','No',NULL,'Theory',' As a part of our M Sc. Program I have chosen Astrophysics, General Relativity and Cosmology as my elective paper I and II respectively. My motivation and passion for research originate from my curiosity about the secrets of the endless dark blue sky filled with stars and the underlying physical phenomena of these magnificent panoramas. Astronomy measures the positions and characteristics of heavenly bodies whereas astrophysics provides the application of physics to understand astronomy. \r\n While doing the course in Astrophysics it often happens to visualize about the astrophysical phenomenon that happens around cosmos. The areas that fascinated me are the solar physics, the activity of sun, solar oscillation etc. It is also very enthusiastic to think about the compact objects like neutron star, white dwarfs and compact binaries because what essentially done is that, connect the physical phenomenon that are well explained are then extended to these astrophysical objects by manipulating the physical parameters appropriately. \r\nI am interested in the study of Quasi-stellar Radio Sources. Quasars have very large redshifts, indicate that they are at great distances. The fact that they are visible at such distances implies that they emit enormous amounts of energy and are certainly not stars. Because they are the most luminous objects known in the universe, they are the objects that have been observed at the greatest distances from us. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey give the images of most distant quasars known. It is found to be interesting. The other area that attract me is the different types of variable stars and the Type l A supernovae. Type l A supernovae are the best cosmological ?standard candles? because it provide information about how fast the universe was expanding at different times in its history by comparing the brightnesses and redshifts of type I A supernovae. The application of artificial intelligence in the astronomical data analysis attracts me very much.As Galileo said, the book of nature is written in the language of mathematics; it seems to be true for modern theoretical physics. Astronomy is the grandparent subject of cosmology. I am very much interested in cosmology, which attempts to answer the questions about the origin, growth and nature of the universe and tries to simplify the complexity of understanding the universe. The exciting phenomena of gravitational physics and the growing connection between theory and observation made me curious. The attractive nature of gravity that plays the role of chief architect in the creation of  cosmic structure. The approach of describing gravity in the framework of Quantum Field Theory is found to be very interesting.','I have done a project entitled The Primordial Density Perturbations from Inflationary Universe,under the guidance of Dr.Kazuyuki Furuuchi, MCNS,Manipal University during June-July,2014.Cosmology can explain the evolution of the entire content in the universe and the underlying physical phenomena.I studied the expanding universe, the Friedmann Lemaitre Robertson Walker Universe,the role of scale factor for expansion and the cosmological parameters first.The Cosmic Microwave Background radiation is a primordial document written by nature opening an account of its origin.The latest studies by Plank Satellite reveals the exact condition of the universe at that time.The limitations of the Hot Big Bang theory lead to various inflationary models, which introduces as a solution to the problems like flatness and horizon problems.There are a large no.of models based on scalar fields.

That incident stood afresh in my mind until I grew up  and started developing a scientific temper. A natural rationale began to push me towards asking newer and better questions-questions that needed answers. It was that young age and still growing sense of science that gave me a feeling that there is a far wider world than the one I was used to seeing. Since then Googling became my daily routine and wikipedia became my best pal. At the age of 8, I got a wonderful opportunity of visiting the Nehru Planetarium in Delhi. That day was by far the first day I could call \"intriguing\". Subsequent visits to the National Science Centre, Jantar Mantar, and Hauz Khas (for night observations of the stars organized by the S.P.A.C.E. organization) gave a tinge along the spine that there is more I can relate with up there than I can relate with down here. As the logical thinking grew, I began to understand the aesthetic adventure and enthusiastically alluring nature of astrophysics. Astronomy meant more to me than all the engineering institutes and medical colleges that apparently promised a seemingly \"bright\" future. Furthermore, after attending several workshops and talks on physics and astrophysics, my interest in the latter intensified. An enlightening talk by Prof Yashpal and Dr Biman Basu (ISRO) gave me a new perspective to look at tings and deepened my love for astrophysics. In the subsequent years, I happened to read science journals (Dream 2047, Scientific American, Astronomy etc) and wonderful books on astronomy and astrophysics (A Brief History of Time, A Briefer History of Time, Universe in a Nutshell, and many more). These made the level of my thinking grow manifold. In the 11th standard, I attended a talk on \"Life on Earth and Beyond\" by Dr Kumar Krishen (Senior Scientist, NASA) which gave my mind a whole new dimension to think in. Since then, my scientific temper has only risen, and the number of the questions my mind used to put up increased, the only major difference being that now I can answer a whole-lot of those questions myself. And yet, as the universe is unending, so are the questions. So I want to pursue astrophysics to have my share of the universe in a nutshell.','Yes, I have carried out various projects and research works as a part of the INSPIRE internship program at the DS Kothari Centre for Research and Innovation at Miranda House, University of Delhi in 11th and 12th standards consecutively.

The quest of searching for the origin of the creation is historical. Conflicting ideas originated among the religious as well as the scientific minds which gradually evolved to the modern day picture of the Universe, which is satisfactorily clear.

The highly elusive ideas of dark matter and dark energy, gravitational wave physics and detection of the same, black holes and the hypothetical concepts of time travel, wormholes, parallel universe and anti-matter are very fascinating and most inspiring.

The very fine physics in astrophysics fascinates me ,the quantum mechanics on the micro level and the general relativity on the macro level are on e of the two most important filed that have fascinated me.I have done a deep study on them.I have done online courses on them and from one of the famous physicist Brian Green.\r\nTheir are many amazing things in the universe that the astronomy deals with.Its fascinating part is Dark Matter and Dark Energy, I have been following this since a long time.And during the time i have completed two online courses on the same.(Dark Matter and Dark Energy from University of Tokyo and also under one of the Famous Scientist Prof.Paulo Salucci).\r\nWhile doing all these work on theory the practical part  has excited me the most in  my journey in Radio Astronomy.I have completed 3 projects in the filed of Radio astronomy that are also a part of SARA(Society of Amateur Radio Astronomers).\r\nFrom the peroid of 2013-2014 and till now I have been involved a lot in Radio astromical projects.I have completed 3 projects namely under IEEE MTT-S  -\r\na)ITTY Bitty RADIO Telescope .\r\nb)NASA Radio Jove\r\nc)Sudden Ionospheric Disturbances.\r\nIn these projects I had done a lot of in analysing the data that I got and also some of the things had created more curiosity in me.\r\nI had studied deeply about the radio science behind it from the basics to the amazing science behind the various phenomenon like Generation of Electromagnetic waves, Pulsars,Quasars,Solar cycle,Solar storms,Storms in Jupiter ,Antenae ,Transmission Lines etc.\r\nAfter completing these projects I have also guided group of students in these projects who also have completed it sucessfully.\r\nNow i am working towards in excelling in those projects by extending their field of scope and also searching for better and new ways.(Like efficiency of antnnae for maximum receiving of radio signals from astronomical bodies.\r\nDuring this phase of my journey in the Radio Astronomy,I have applied all my theoritical knowledge and worked into implementing it.\r\nThese three projects covered 3 different domains but were related to one field Radio Astronomy.\r\nAlso during mentoring the students also gave me a boost towards working in this field.Also I had started a Radio Astronomy Club in my college to spread the knowledge and also encouraged other students to work in the field of radio astronomy.\r\nAlso I have an participated in various night sky observational activities at Nehru Planetorium and also in IIT Delhi.\r\nAfter having all things in my mind i have implemented all my thoughts was also one of the motivating factor.My work was also published i n SARA Journal and also in NASA Journal.','Done a project on radio astronomy, Itty Bitty Radio Telescope ,under IEEE MTT-S SUMMER GRANT PROGRAM (2013).In this project ,I used parabolic dish antennae to collect the radio waves given out by the celestial or material bodies as BLACKBODY RADIATION  like tree,sun,ground against the blank sky etc.On the basis of the readings ,by using computer simulation I plotted a graph of the observed intensity.It was also awarded as the best project in the program.\r\n\r\nI have done project on NASA Radio Jove in which I have monitored the Radio Storms from Jupiter.

It was the earliest science that was trying to peer into and see the clockwork of the universe on its grand scale. Throughout history, people from Galileo to Stephen Hawking and many more putting their effort to explain and explore the physical nature of our universe and the way it behaves. This is the science which has most capture, the general public imagination about the outer world existence and experiences. With the development of science and technology we built modern telescope, detectors and spectroscopic techniques, now we are able to probe the whole universe and its intelligent illusion, complexity, grand design and self-organization. With this we have mapped our universe few second right after BigBang and its accelerating expansion, the mysterious dark energy and dark matter, the black holes, the interstellar phenomena. But its not the end, that we have full knowledge about our universe. There are interestingly challenging riddles that have not yet known and in most circumstances the physical theory does not match well.\r\n \r\nWith the vast development of science, now we have many interdisciplinary as, high-energy and particle physics, cosmology, string theory, astronomy and astrophysics, space science, cosmic science. All are strongly interconnected and researchers in these fields trying to peer into the clockwork of the universe from fundamental constituent of matter to the universe in cosmic grand scale and its self-organization to get full knowledge of our universe and the ways it is. I believe that, this objective is now close at hand that, with this knowledge we can bridge few remaining gaps about our knowledge of, the existence of our universe and its laws and simple matter to life, and with reasonable confidence we can say from where we came from and to where we are going and I would like to join the people realizing it.\r\n','My M.sc. project was on Computational Holography.
